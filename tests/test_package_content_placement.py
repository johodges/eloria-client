"""A server-authority marker is drawn where the server runs it.

Harvest nodes and NPC markers are declared twice in a package manifest: a
placement in metres, which is where the client draws the model, and a
`serverTile`, which is the tile the server runs the node on.

They drifted once. Several were authored on tiles their own package's walk
grid blocks, so when the server began enforcing that collision the node moved
and the model stayed behind, leaving a harvestable you could see but not
reach. `eloria-assets/tools/sync_package_content.py` moves the models onto the
server's tiles; this holds them there.
