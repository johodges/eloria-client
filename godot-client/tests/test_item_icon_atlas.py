"""Grid and coverage checks for the inventory item icon atlases.

Added 2026-08-28 for Eloria Client.

``ItemAtlas`` slices every icon at ``(id % columns) * cell, (id / columns) *
cell``.  The shipped atlases were pasted below that grid, so icons from id 25
upwards rendered with a slice of their neighbour, and the sixteen Nymara
materials were flat placeholder polygons.  These tests pin the grid, the icon
coverage and the fallback so a future atlas edit cannot silently drift again.
