extends SceneTree
## Guards the Summoning window and the two seams it depends on.
##
## The window is a view of two honest sources: the client's own compiled
## recipe catalog, and the server's state in AppState - inventory, skills,
## nexus, ether. It lists the summons alone, dims what the client can see no
## way to call, writes the first blocking reason where the ingredients would
## go, and its rows only ask: a click hands the ingredient picks to a
## Callable and the server decides whether anything is standing there
## afterwards.
##
## The last section is not about the window. It is the wire fact the window
## exists to be reachable from: a summon's actor packet says "summon" only in
## the colour byte on its name, and it now also carries the summoner's guild
## tag. Both are decoded here through the client's real decoder, because the
## click that opens the behaviour popup is gated on the first and the
## nameplate is drawn from the second.
