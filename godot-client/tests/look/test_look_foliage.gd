extends SceneTree
## Guards the look pass's painted crowns and dithered occluder fade (layer L3).
##
## With ELORIA_LOOK=0 the crowns keep the loader's materials and
## OccluderFade blends exactly as on develop. With it on, only crowns are
## painted (never trunks, ground or a merged scatter mesh), the source
## materials and meshes are never edited, painting twice is harmless, a
## crown's jitter seed does not move when the world is rebased, a batch and
## its hidden members draw the same crown, and OccluderFade opens a hole round
## the player in painted and standard materials, lets a faded crown's shadow go
## (as develop's blended copies do) but keeps a wall's on a twin, and puts
## everything back after.
