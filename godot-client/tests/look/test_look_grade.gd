extends SceneTree
## Guards the look pass's grade (layer L1).
##
## The grade is re-applied after every binder rewrite, up to ten times a
## second, so it must never compound: scaling a value it already scaled would
## walk the sun towards orange and the ambient towards black within a minute.
## With ELORIA_LOOK unset it must change nothing at all, and an interior, whose
## lamps are its whole lighting, is never graded.
