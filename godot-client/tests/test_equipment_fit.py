"""The registry contract that lets one garment fit sixteen different bodies.

Generated garments have original-art male/female body fits and retained-head variants. Their
shared skeleton needs no runtime girth or rest-height correction. The registry
also retains a legacy fit profile for existing procedural garments and props.

* ``bodyGirth`` and ``footAnchor`` describe current weighted body geometry.
* ``fitGroups`` select the shared male/female garment or the individual head
  variant. ``bodyTemplates`` prevent repeating a fit on identical body geometry.
* ``fitProfiles.legacy`` preserves the old measurements and scale for items
  outside the source-equipment rebuild.

A break in either one is silent in the editor and obvious on a player, so the
shape of the data is checked here rather than discovered in a screenshot.
