## Guilds were in the server for a long time with nothing drawing them, so the
## risk here is not that the window looks wrong - it is that it says something
## the server did not. Every payload below is the exact output of the server's
## own builder in `eloria/protocol.py`, and every button press is checked
## against the bytes it puts on the wire, because a button that sends almost
## the right command is a button that silently does nothing.

var failures := 0
## Everything the window asked the server to do, as text and as the frame that
## text becomes. `main.gd` hands the window `Network.send_chat`; this hands it
## the recorder instead, which is the same seam.
