"""Regressions for the folded groin and upper back reported on 2026-09-08.

Check the serialized rest surface itself: smooth weights can still leave a
fold baked into positions when source/canonical pelvis origins differ.

The Human (luminous_*) bodies these were written against were regenerated
from Meshy on 2026-10-05, so the checks now hold the new bodies to the same
contract. The new bodies share one position buffer across all seven body
surfaces, so a surface is only the vertices its own triangles use. They are
also coarser (a fifth to two-fifths of the old faces in these regions), and
their skin/shirt/trouser borders are cut along the painted seams, which
leaves many sliver triangles at the neckline and armholes. A count of
reversed faces therefore measures sliver count, not fold size, so the fold
checks weigh reversed faces by area.
