extends SceneTree
## Guards the two things the HUD follow-up promised about windows and icons.
##
## Every window moves by its title bar, as Eternal Lands moves all of its own,
## and a window dragged past the edge is pulled back rather than lost - a
## window whose title bar left the screen could never be dragged back.
##
## The sit icon is a pair, the way icon_window.cpp's multi-icon is: it wears
## the stand icon while the player is seated, because standing is what pressing
## it does then.

## Every scene window that must answer to a drag, and the handle it is grabbed
## by. The console and the full map are deliberately absent: both are
## full-screen views rather than popups.
