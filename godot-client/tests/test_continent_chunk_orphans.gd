## A live chunk import worker is never joined on the main thread. Joining it
## while it waits for rendering-server commands that only this thread services
## froze the client (no frames, no heartbeats) on a server teleport during a
## neighbour load. Owners that leave the tree or re-prime orphan the worker; the
## exterior stream reaps it once it reports finished.
