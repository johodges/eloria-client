"""Prove spell power against the genuine Eloria server.

Power is entirely the server's: what a cast will use, and what the character's
Magic level and nexus allow. The only way to read either was `#sp`, which
answers in chat text - so a client had to either parse the chat stream or keep
its own copy of the progression rules. `ELORIA_SPELL_POWER(231)` states both,
and the legacy cast frame takes an optional trailing power byte the client now
sends.

Credentials are generated per run, held only in memory, and never printed; the
report records them as REDACTED.

Usage: python tests/integration/spell_power_local.py <server-root>
