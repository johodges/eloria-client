## Race features under equipment: the runtime half of race programme P4.
##
## A race feature is a mesh node of its own on the race body:
## `race_feature_head` (Votary horns, Stoneborn crown, Glasswarden crystals) and
## `race_feature_shoulders` (Mycelari growths). This checks what the actor does
## with them:
##   - headwear follows models["3:N"].raceFeatures, which is copied from
##     eloria-assets/tools/headwear_race_policy.json (checked here too): a
##     "hide" helm hides hair, scalp and the features; a "show" hood hides the
##     hair only and keeps scalp and features on a body with the feature node
##     (a body without one hides its scalp as before); an open band hides
##     nothing; a piece with no policy hides the features when it covers the
##     hair;
##   - every torso and every cape hides the shoulder growths unless the item
##     says "show", headwear marked raceShoulders "hide" (policy `shoulders`)
##     hides them too, and taking them off brings the growths back;
##   - no skin, hair or eye choice puts a material on a feature node.
## Until the rebuilt bodies carry the nodes, a body without one gets a
## synthetic copy of its scalp (or shirt) under the feature name, with a
## feature material of its own; a body that has the node is used as it is.
