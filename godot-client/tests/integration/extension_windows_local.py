"""Prove the nine extension windows against the genuine Eloria server.

The Godot client advertises ten capability strings and then renders whatever
the server pushes. This probe starts the real `eloria.server`, logs in twice -
once advertising the capabilities and once not - and checks that the server
answers the capable session with the extension packets the windows are built
on, and the plain session with the legacy text. The merchant case also proves
today's server change: selecting an item no longer draws the NPC dialogue that
used to cover the merchant window.

Credentials are generated per run, held only in memory, and never printed; the
report records them as REDACTED.

Usage: python tests/integration/extension_windows_local.py <server-root>
