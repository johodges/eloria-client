## Rendered evidence for server-placed map markers.
##
## The "before" frame is the full map with the marker packet already reduced
## into state but the map named as somewhere else - which is exactly what the
## shipped client did with every marker, because nothing decoded command 90 at
## all. The "after" frame is the same map once the marker belongs to it.
##
## The gameplay capture verifies the separate green effect and floating label.
