## Rendered evidence that a large creature stands in the middle of its ground.
##
## The server reserves a box of tiles around the tile an actor reports, and
## measures reach from the edges of that box. The client's whole job here is
## to draw the model in the middle of it - and the tile an actor reports is
## *not* the middle whenever an extent is even, so getting this wrong puts a
## two-by-two creature half a tile off the ground it holds.
##
## Assertions can only check the arithmetic. What they cannot check is whether
## the model looks like it is standing on the highlighted squares, which is
## the thing a person has to be able to see - so each footprint is drawn with
## its reserved tiles marked underneath it, from a camera high enough to read
## the grid.
##
## The footprints below are the ones the profile actually authors, taken from
## `tools/measure_creature_footprints.py`, not sizes invented for a picture.
