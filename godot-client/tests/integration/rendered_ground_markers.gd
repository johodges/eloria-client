## What a player sees of the marker under their character while they run.
##
## Whitehorn Range is the region the flicker was reported on, and this walks a
## selected actor across it through the client's own world loader, camera rig
## and actor, counting the marker's pixels twice at every step: once as the
## depth buffer leaves it, and once with the depth test off, which is the whole
## marker. The share between them is how much of it the ground is eating, and
## the way that share used to jump from step to step is the flicker itself.
##
## Only the terrain is left standing. A rock parked between the camera and the
## marker hides part of it for a good reason; the ground the marker is lying on
## should not.
