"""Prove ranged combat's missile packets against the genuine Eloria server.

`MISSILE_AIM_A_AT_B(84)` and `MISSILE_FIRE_A_TO_B(86)` were undecoded, so a
ranged fight was two actors standing still while damage numbers appeared -
nothing was ever drawn between them.

This probe equips a real bow and arrows from the shipped catalog, walks far
enough away from a real creature for the server to allow ranging, attacks it,
and reads the aim and the shot off the wire.

Credentials are generated per run, held only in memory, and never printed; the
report records them as REDACTED.

Usage: python tests/integration/ranging_local.py <server-root>
