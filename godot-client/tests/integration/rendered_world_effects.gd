## Rendered evidence for the effects the server says happened in the world.
##
## The "before" frame is two actors standing in the world with the effect
## packet already reduced and nothing on screen - which is what every
## `SEND_SPECIAL_EFFECT(79)` looked like, because the client had no decoder for
## it. The "after" frames are the same view with an effect at one actor and an
## effect travelling between two.
