"""Prove placed sound and map music against the real server.

A recorded gap: `PLAY_SOUND(14)` and `PLAY_MUSIC(54)` were unallocated, so all
of this client's audio was its own answer to state about the player. What was
missing was everything happening to somebody else, and what the map sounds
like.

Two clients log in together, because the rule that keeps this honest is that
the server does not send a sound to the client that caused it - that client
already knows, and would otherwise hear everything twice.

Credentials are generated per run, held only in memory, and never printed; the
report records them as REDACTED.

Usage: python tests/integration/audio_local.py <server-root>
