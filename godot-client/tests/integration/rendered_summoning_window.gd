## Rendered evidence for the summoning window.
##
## The headless suite proves what the window says; this proves it can be read.
## The window is built entirely in code - the rows are Buttons with a container
## pinned across each one - so nothing but a frame shows whether the icon, the
## name, the requirements and the costs actually land in their four places
## instead of on top of each other.
##
## Three states are captured, because telling them apart is the window's job:
## a summoner who can afford one of the three and not the other two; the same
## window once the server has granted the skill, the nexus and the reagents
## for all three; and the same again against a server that does not name the
## inventory slots, where a reagent whose artwork is shared cannot be picked
## and the window says so rather than guessing.
