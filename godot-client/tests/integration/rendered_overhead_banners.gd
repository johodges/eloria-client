## Rendered evidence for the overhead block: the name, and the health bar the
## player's target wears.
##
## Two claims, neither of which a normal assertion can see on its own.
##
## The first is that a name is the same size to read wherever the actor is
## standing and whatever the camera's zoom is. Your own name and health are a
## 2D panel projected over your head, so they have always been a fixed size on
## screen; a creature's were a Label3D, which shrinks with distance like the
## creature does. A name is text, not scenery - it should be as legible across
## the field as it is underfoot. The arithmetic behind that is checked below
## against the camera's own projection, and the pictures are what show it
## reading as one size rather than merely measuring as one.
##
## The second is who wears a bar. Every actor packet carries a health pair, so
## the client can draw one over everything in sight, and used to - a field of
## bars, none of which is the one being swung at. Now it is the creature the
## player is fighting, and every other player whether or not there is a fight:
## a person's condition is worth reading before you walk into it, a passing
## rabbit's is not.
