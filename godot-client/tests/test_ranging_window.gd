extends SceneTree
## Guards the ranging window.
##
## The window is a session tally of what the client honestly saw: a shot is a
## `missile_fired` event from the local actor, a hit is a ranging experience
## award, and everything else on it is arithmetic on those two counts. These
## tests emit the same signals AppState emits and expect the rows to say
## exactly what was counted - including while the panel is hidden, because a
## stat that only counted while watched would lie.
