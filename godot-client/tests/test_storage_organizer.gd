extends SceneTree
## The stored-items organizer: sub-filtering one storage category by the type
## of item, and ordering it by name, strength, or rarity.
##
## Withdrawal is by server position, so the point every check comes back to is
## that reordering and filtering never disturb the position carried as an
## item's metadata - a sorted list that withdrew the wrong item would be worse
## than no sorting at all.

var failures := 0

## Four stored rows in one category, deliberately in no useful order: two
## torso pieces and two greaves, with strength and rarity disagreeing so each
## sort has to prove itself.
