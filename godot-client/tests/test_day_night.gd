## Guards the day/night cycle.
##
## The daylight curve is the server's own - `World` uses
## `(1 - cos(2*PI*minute/360)) / 2` to decide how far a creature can see - and
## this suite pins the client to that same expression, so what the player sees
## and what the server acts on cannot drift apart. The manifest is the noon
## reference; a package that declares no sun, or opts out, is left alone.
