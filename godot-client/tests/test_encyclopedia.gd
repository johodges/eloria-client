extends SceneTree
## Guards the encyclopedia and the move icon's attack preview.
##
## The encyclopedia is half written and half built. The written half is checked
## for being reachable; the built half is checked against the catalogue it was
## built from, so a page can never quietly claim a level, a cost or a material
## the recipe table does not state.
##
## The move icon is checked for the one rule that is easy to get wrong: Alt is
## a preview and not a mode, so it must never disturb an attack mode the player
## chose from the HUD.
