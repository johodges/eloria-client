## The map cache: the key, the invalidation contract, and the batch links.
##
## `WorldLoader` writes the region it built to `user://map-cache` and reads it
## back on the next visit instead of parsing the package again. The thing that
## makes that safe rather than reckless is the key: an entry is named after the
## package's own bytes and the loader's cache-format version, so an entry that
## does not match what is on disk is not found at all, and the region is
## rebuilt. Everything below is that contract.
##
## The region used is `four-gates-deposit-four-keys`, the smallest shipped
## package at 3.1 MB, copied into a scratch directory first: the tests that
## prove a changed package misses have to change a package, and they may not
## change one in the repository.
##
## Run: Godot_v4.7.2-stable_win64.exe --headless --path . \

## looking through, `SecretSections` hides an undiscovered section, and
## `OccluderFade` hangs a duplicated translucent material on whatever stands
## between the camera and the player and makes a batched prop's own node
## visible so it can be seen fading. None of that is the region; all of it is
## the client's opinion of the region a moment ago. Packed in, it would be
## permanent, and it would be permanent only for players whose cache happened
## to be written on a frame where the camera was in the wrong place - the worst
## kind of bug to be handed.
##
## So the loader takes the three values that can move while the tree is still
## only its own, puts them back for the length of the pack, and restores
