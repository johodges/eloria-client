## Draws the minimap's marks at a fixed size on screen, whatever the zoom.
##
## Every mark on both maps used to be a disc modelled in the world on the
## map-marker visual layer, which both top-down cameras rendered. A disc
## measured in metres is a different number of pixels at every zoom, so zooming
## the minimap out shrank the actor dots to specks and zooming in swelled them
## into saucers that ran into each other - and a player reading a minimap is
## reading the marks, not the ground under them.
##
## So the minimap camera stopped rendering that layer. Everything it marks is
## projected through that camera and drawn here in pixels instead, at the size
## the player asked for and nothing else. The full map keeps the modelled
## discs: it frames a whole map at one fixed scale, so nothing there changes
## size, and the marks it draws are sized for that scale.
##
## The overlay owns no marker state. `main.gd` hands it the marks each time the
## minimap render is refreshed, and it projects them through the same camera
## that rendered the image underneath, so a mark cannot drift off the ground it
## is standing on.

## A mark's radius in pixels at marker size "Normal", before the player's
## scale. Small enough that a crowded town is still a map rather than a mass of
## overlapping circles, big enough to pick a colour out of at a glance.
