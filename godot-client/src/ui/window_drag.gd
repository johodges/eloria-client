class_name WindowDrag
extends Node
## Moves one window by its title bar, the way Eternal Lands moves every one of
## its windows.
##
## Only the inventory, the ground bag and the minimap could be moved here, and
## each carried its own copy of the same handler. This is that behaviour as a
## single node: it is added as a child of the window it moves, so a window that
## is freed takes its dragging with it, and a window that has never been shown
## costs nothing.
##
## The window is kept inside the viewport and off the fixed resource rail. A
## window dragged until its title bar left the screen could not be dragged
## back, so the clamp is what keeps a moved window recoverable rather than a
## tidiness rule.

## Nothing may cover the fixed resource rail down the right-hand edge.
const RESERVED_RIGHT_RAIL := 96.0
const EDGE_MARGIN := 6.0

## Emitted when a drag ends, for a caller that remembers where its window was.
