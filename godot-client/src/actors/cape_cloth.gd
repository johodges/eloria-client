## Verlet cloth for the cape chains on the player rig.
##
## A cape skinned to the spine cannot avoid a leg. Measured against the shared
## clips, the body passes 254 mm behind the cape in a walk and 858 mm in a run,
## and weighting the hem to the thighs does not help: one cape spanning both
## legs follows their average, which is exactly where neither leg is.
##
## So the rig carries three chains of four bones - cape_{l,c,r}_01..04 - that no
## clip in the shared library names, and this drives them. Three chains rather
## than one because a single column cannot twist, and the halves of a cape have
## to part around a leg independently.
##
## The simulation runs in world space, not skeleton space, so the cape trails
## when the actor runs rather than only reacting to the spine bobbing. It is a
## SkeletonModifier3D so the engine orders it after the animation has posed the
## skeleton; writing bone poses from _process would race the AnimationPlayer.
