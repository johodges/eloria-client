class_name LookFade
extends RefCounted
## Look pass layer L3: occluders open a hole round the player instead of
## blending. Used by OccluderFade only when LookProfile.enabled(); with the
## pass off OccluderFade blends exactly as it does on develop.
##
## OccluderFade fades an obstacle by swapping in a copy of its material that
## alpha-blends towards FADED_ALPHA. A blended surface stops writing depth, so
## a faded crown's hundreds of overlapping leaf cards sort against each other
## and against the ground and read as a brown smear, and a roof loses its own
## shading under the blend. The pass first dithered the whole occluder
## instead, a one-pixel screen-door at 35 % coverage, which read as a
## crosshatched window screen over up to a fifth of the frame. Now the
## occluder stays solid, lit and depth-tested as always, and a round hole
## with a dithered rim opens where it covers the player
## (look_fade_hole.gdshaderinc), as the reference frames' crown fade cuts one.
## The fade's timing is OccluderFade's, unchanged: it opens the hole.
##
## - A painted look material (LookFoliage's crowns, LookGround's blended
##   ground) names its dithered variant in FADED_SHADER_META; the copy
##   switches to that shader and OccluderFade opens its hole.
## - A StandardMaterial3D is copied into look_faded_standard.gdshader, which
##   draws what the engine would draw for it and cuts the hole. The
##   engine's own dither for it, hashed alpha, is ignored by the compatibility
##   renderer (its copies drew fully opaque there). A material using a feature
##   that shader does not reproduce keeps develop's blended copy.
## - Any other ShaderMaterial is left solid, as on develop.
##
## Every one of them cuts the same hole, and only the faded copies carry its
## discard, so a resting surface keeps the engine's early depth test.
##
## How an occluder fades is decided per occluder as its fade begins (`mode_of`):
##
## - HOLE: a painted crown, and a mid-sized prop, roof or wall that covers
##   little of the view - a round hole opens round the player, the rest stays.
## - VANISH: the dithered copy dissolves the whole mesh as the fade opens and
##   draws none of it once open. For what a hole cannot leave readable: a roof
##   or tent whose footprint holds the player (a Sunmane yurt drew a straw
##   cone over them with a porthole in it), a thin post, pillar, beam or wall
##   (Whitehorn's gate pillars and Verdant's hub gate kept a solid bar across
##   the frame), and anything that covers more than FADE_VANISH_COVERAGE of
##   the view (the Grey Moors' turf roof, a quarter of the frame, near-black
##   round a hole). Blended instead, as develop does, a roof over a room read
##   as a grey smear of the room (aw_coppice); gone, the room reads.
## - BLEND: develop's own fade (OccluderFade's alpha-blended copies), for
##   interiors (`bind`), water (`is_water`), and anything wider across the
##   ground than FADE_SOLID_MAX_METRES, or part of a structure that is (a
##   giant dome's pieces).
##
## A faded copy would cast its hole into its shadow too, so while a mesh fades
## by its hole or vanishes it stops casting. A wall or a roof that keeps its
## hole hands its shadow to a shadow-only twin with its resting materials,
## because a room lighting up under a roof the viewer still sees reads as a
## bug; one that vanishes casts none, as develop's blended copies cast none. A crown casts none, as develop's
## blended copies cast none: the twin held a giant canopy's whole shadow over
## the player and took the deep grove from luminance 80 to 64 (53 in Forward+),
## the darkest frame of the pass, where walking under a tree on develop lights
## the ground. A blended occluder keeps develop's shadow exactly: a twin there
## laid the Sunmane gauntlet's canyon walls' full shadows beside the player as
## hard dark quads under walls the viewer sees as ghosts.
##
## The ground never fades. Develop has no walk collision on the continent's
## authored ground patches, so the patch a player stands on was indexed as an
## occluder and faded to glass under their feet; with the pass on, anything
## LookGround paints as ground is kept out of the index, as walk surfaces are.
