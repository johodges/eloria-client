## The frame-level look pass: its one switch and every constant it tunes.
##
## The pass is the client's look: it is on unless the client was started with
## ELORIA_LOOK=0, and that one switch is the whole of its off path. Every
## layer asks `enabled()` first and does nothing when it is false, which gives
## back the frames the client drew before the pass (the look-off renders match
## them within run-to-run noise), for an A/B capture or to rule the pass out
## when a frame looks wrong. Forward+ is the renderer it is tuned for; the
## compatibility renderer (the OpenGL fallback, and CI's rendered tests) keeps
## its own trims wherever the two light differently.
##
## The constants live here, not beside the code that uses them, so the whole
## look can be read, compared and retuned in one place. They are every map's
## defaults: what a map or region does differently (its grade and ground
## trims, grass palette, fallback sky, sea, extra foliage names) lives in its
## own file, regions/<id>.json, read through `region` and the accessors below
## it (see regions/README.md), so one region can be retuned without touching
## another's. They are tuned for the
## isometric camera's default framing (pitch -60, 26 m away). There four
## fifths of the frame is ground, so the grade matters more than the sky; only
## the low views (pitch -30 and -20) reach the horizon.

## The environment variable that turns the pass off: "0" and nothing else.
const ENABLE_VARIABLE := "ELORIA_LOOK"
## Picks another tone curve for an A/B capture ("agx", "aces" or "filmic").
## Unset, the pass uses TONEMAP_CURVE.
const TONEMAP_VARIABLE := "ELORIA_LOOK_TONEMAP"

# --- Grade (layer L1) --------------------------------------------------------

## The tone curve every outdoor map is graded through. The manifests disagree:
## Lantern Reach declares Filmic with a white of 1, which clips every bright
## channel and is why its grass and trail read neon; Four Gates declares
## Filmic with a white of 9, which folds its pale stone into flat grey; and
## Amberwood declares nothing, so it falls back to a linear curve that leaves
## its ground dull and dark. One curve gives the three places one exposure
## language, and the continent's seams need one anyway: the lighting manifest
## blends between neighbours every 100 ms, but the curve is only chosen at
## bind, so a player who walked in from Four Gates saw Amberwood through Four
## Gates' curve and one who logged in there saw it linear.
##
## AgX, from a compatibility-renderer A/B at matched mid-grey: ACES had the
## most contrast but blew Four Gates' paving out (luminance 167 against 144)
## and crushed 3 % of Lantern Reach's low view to black; Filmic kept Lantern
## Reach's trail neon orange; AgX rolled the pale stone off softly, turned the
## trail to sand and the red maples towards copper, and crushed nothing.
const TONEMAP_CURVE := "agx"
## Each curve with the exposure that puts mid-grey near the same display
## value, so an A/B compares the curves' shapes rather than their brightness.
## AgX's contrast is its own; the other two shape contrast by their white.
## AgX carries all of the grade's contrast (see CONTRAST): 1.35 against its
## default 1.25 opens Amberwood's value spread from 26 to 33. Forward+ rolls
## the highlights off harder than the compatibility renderer (the brightest
## tenth of a Four Gates or Lantern Reach frame 15-25 levels lower at the same
## mid-grey), which left its frames flat (value spread 24-37 against 40-45);
## it takes 1.65, with SATURATION_FORWARD taking back the chroma a stronger
## per-channel curve adds and TOE_LIFT the blacks it deepens. AgX's white
## (agx_white) was tried as the highlight lever and changed nothing measurable.
const TONEMAP_CURVES := {
	"agx": {"mode": Environment.TONE_MAPPER_AGX, "exposure": 1.15,

## The adjustment's own contrast, left neutral. It is a straight line through
## display mid-grey applied to each channel after the curve, so it drives the
## smallest channel of a dark saturated colour to zero: at 1.08 the dark side
## of the red maples went from (32, 23, 16) to (16, 6, 1) and the navy slate at
## Four Gates' east gate to (2, 12, 25). Even 1.03 crushed 3 % of that frame.
## Raising AgX's own contrast instead gave the same value spread with those
## colours intact, because its curve eases into black rather than clipping.
const CONTRAST := 1.0
## A toe under the curve, drawn after it as a per-channel lookup on display
## values: a display value x below TOE_END is lifted by TOE_LIFT * (1 -
## x / TOE_END)^2, so black itself becomes TOE_LIFT and the lift has run out,
## smoothly, by TOE_END. It keeps the darkest authored colours (the navy slate
## at Four Gates' east gate, the coppice's dark timber and the maples' crimson
## shade, 5-6 % of those frames below luminance 20 once the curve's contrast
## was raised for Forward+) out of black without greying the mid-tones the
## contrast is for. 0 turns it off.

## Saturation for a map that declares none. Below 1 because the tone curve adds
## chroma: AgX's contrast acts on each channel apart, and at 1.0 it took
## Amberwood's orange leaf litter and Four Gates' lime grass most of the way to
## neon. At 0.9 Amberwood still measured 0.60 (the reference frames average
## 0.51). Forward+ takes less for its stronger curve (AGX contrast 1.65): at

## tints its shade brown. Keeping this share of the sky lets the cool colour
## reach the shade.
const AMBIENT_SKY_SHARE := 0.75
## The fill keeps its strength. Cutting it to 0.88 for contrast moved the

## that SSAO already darkens in Forward+; the tone curve does that job better.
const AMBIENT_ENERGY_SCALE := 1.0

## A map's own trims on the exposure and saturation above live in its region
## file's `grade` section (see REGIONS_DIRECTORY; Lantern Reach's is the only
## one). Only a map that is never streamed beside another may have them: a
## trim changes the moment the active map does, which on the continent would
## be a visible step at every crossing, so the continent's regions share one
## grade and `map_trim` ignores a continent region's `grade` section.
## Forward+ draws the continent darker than the compatibility renderer does
## (Four Gates luminance 92 against 123, Amberwood 58 against 72, mostly its
## SSAO and linear lighting), so it takes this much more exposure everywhere.
## A per-map trim cannot close the gap on the continent, whose regions share
## one grade (Amberwood streams beside Four Gates); Lantern Reach's own trim
## (regions/lantern_reach.json) is divided by it. 1.65 (it was 1.12, then 1.42) also pays for the stronger

## leaves the player's surroundings clear and gathers only beyond them, where

# --- Ground (layer L2) -------------------------------------------------------

## The painted ground's value hierarchy. The reference frames read because
## their roads are the palest thing on the ground (a path is 1.25-1.72 times
## the luminance of the grass beside it); Four Gates' roads were darker than
## the grass they cross (0.5) and Amberwood's matched their floor (1.0). The
## values below act on linear albedo, before the light and the AgX curve, and
## the grade pulls chroma down by about 14 %, so they are authored a little
## richer than they would look in a paint program.
##
## A path is repainted rather than lifted: its texture's grain is kept, but
## its value and colour are set outright, so a road reads the same wherever
## the exporter's worn tint happens to sit. The worn-road decks are a
## saturated orange-brown of luminance 0.056 (the shared ground texture under
## the worn tint #997a4f); lifting that colour kept its red hue, which Forward+
## lit rose and mauve and the compatibility renderer grey. PATH_LUMA is the
## albedo luminance a road is painted at; a region whose verge is much darker
## than Four Gates' grass trims it (its region file's `ground` section, see
## `ground_value`), because the path/ground
## ratio is what the eye reads, and 0.24 over Amberwood's floor (0.04) made its

## Pale ground in this hue window (sRGB degrees) and at least GOLD_SATURATION

## (241, 202, 81 became 188, 157, 90), so gold is painted a little darker and
## richer, where the curve leaves its chroma alone. The compatibility renderer
## washes painted chroma out and takes more: at 1.5 in both, Forward+ drove
