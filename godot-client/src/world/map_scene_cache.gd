class_name MapSceneCache
extends RefCounted

## The built form of a region, kept on the player's own disk.
##
## A map load is a freeze. `WorldLoader` got the worst region from 7.9 s to
## 1.2 s by bucketing wide sibling lists, and what is left is the glTF parse,
## the walk-surface collision and the mip chains - work that produces the same
## tree every time from bytes that do not change between one launch and the
## next. So the first visit to a region packs the tree the loader built into a
## `PackedScene` and writes it under `user://`, and every visit after that
## reads it back instead of parsing the package again.
##
## Nothing here ships in the repository. The cache is built on the machine that
## plays the game, from the package that machine has, and it is keyed on that
## package's own bytes: a client update that changes a map rebuilds its cache
## the first time the map is entered, without anyone having to remember to.
##
## ## The key
##
## `package_digest()` is sha256 over the region's `world.glb` and its
## `world.json`, in that order, wrapped in a version string. The manifest is
## normalised to LF first, because it is a text file that git and Python both
## rewrite the line endings of, and a digest that changed with the checkout
## would be worthless as the cross-check the server sends (see
## `ELORIA_MAP_DIGEST` in `src/network/protocol.gd`). The glb is binary and is
## hashed exactly as it sits.
##
## The cache file name folds `CACHE_FORMAT_VERSION` into that digest, so the
## two ways a cache entry can go stale are the same mechanism: change the
## package and the digest moves, change what the loader builds and the version
## moves. Either way the name the loader looks for is not the name on disk, the
## entry is a miss, and the stale file is removed when the new one lands. The
## failure the doc warned about - a loader change with no version bump, leaving
## a map that is subtly wrong and silent - is a code review away rather than a
## debugging session away, and `format_version_note()` is what a reviewer is
## pointed at.
##
## ## What this is not
##
## It is not a content-distribution mechanism and it is not authoritative. If
## the file is missing, unreadable, truncated or built by another version, the
## loader parses the package exactly as it did before. Every path through here
## degrades to "load it the slow way".

## Bumped whenever `WorldLoader` would build a different tree from the same
## package: a new pass, a changed pass, a different name, a different layer, a
## different piece of metadata. A bump invalidates every entry on every
## player's disk at once, which costs them one slow load per region and is the
## cheap half of the bargain.
##
## 1 - first version: collision bodies, walk surfaces, navigation collision,
##     static batching, mip chains and the batch links as node paths.
const CACHE_FORMAT_VERSION := 1

## Wrapped into the digest so the hash of a package cannot be confused with the
## hash of anything else, and so the digest itself can be revised without
## colliding with the values a previous client wrote. This string is part of

## computes the same digest the same way.

## extension and refuses to write a file it does not recognise.
