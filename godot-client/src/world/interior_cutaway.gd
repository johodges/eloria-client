class_name InteriorCutaway
extends RefCounted

## Keeps an interior visible from the isometric rig.
##
## An interior is a closed box: ceiling on top, four walls around. A camera
## framed for open ground sits above the ceiling and behind the near wall, so
## without a cutaway the player sees a roof and nothing else. This hides the
## ceiling outright and hides whichever wall the camera is currently looking
## through, following the rig as it rotates. Only visibility changes -- the
## collision bodies the world loader built from the same nodes stay in place,
## so a cut-away wall is still solid.
##
## Driven by the manifest's `cutaway` block, so the city (which has no such
## block) is untouched.
