## The click-to-walk cross: four corner wedges that collapse into the tile a
## click ordered the player to, after the marker the legacy client draws in
## `highlight.c`.
##
## The reference behaviour, kept exactly: the marker lives for half a second;
## its corners start pushed half a tile outwards and slide into the centre at
## a rate of age² so the collapse starts fast and lands softly; the whole
## cross appears 0.3 m off the ground and settles onto it as it ages; and it
## fades with age, drawn additively so it reads as light on the ground rather
## than paint. A walking destination is green. The legacy client's other
## marker colours - spell target, attack target, lock - can join later
## through `configure`'s colour.

## Layer 2: the gameplay camera renders it, the minimap and full-map cameras
## do not. The legacy client never draws the cross on its maps either.
