class_name AmbientAudioBinder
extends RefCounted
## Turns a manifest's `environment.ambientAudio` into real sound in the scene.
##
## The four-gates package has declared its ambience since it was authored - a
## civic murmur over the central plaza and falling water at every `Waterfall_`
## node - and nothing read it, so every map was silent. This is the client side
## of that contract, in the same shape as the light-marker binder: the package
## names a loop, a gain and where it belongs, and the client plays it.
##
## An entry that names a `nodePrefix` becomes one positional player per matching
## node in the loaded scene, at the declared radius. An entry without one is
## played flat, because a `region` is an area the manifest does not give
## geometry for and guessing a position for it would be inventing placement.
##
## Maps that declare nothing get nothing, which is every package but one.
