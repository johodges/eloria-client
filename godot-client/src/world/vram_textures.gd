extends RefCounted

## How the map loader produces the textures of a content-addressed map image.
##
## A map package names its images by URI and lists each one in its manifest's
## `externalResources` with the sha256 of the file. Left to itself,
## `GLTFDocument` decodes every such image on the importing thread, uploads it
## without mips, and `WorldLoader._build_texture_mipmaps` (or
## `ExternalTexturePool.share`) then reads it back from the GPU, builds the mip
## chain and uploads it a second time. A `.jpg` URI without a `mimeType` is
## also tried as PNG first, which is where the "Not a PNG file" lines came from.
##
## `map_image_extension.gd` replaces that with one preparation per image, done
## in parallel on the WorkerThreadPool before the document is parsed, and the
## texture GLTFDocument creates from it is the finished one. An image another
## map already holds in `ExternalTexturePool` is not prepared at all. Nothing in
## the preparation touches the RenderingServer, so it is safe on any thread; see
## eloria-chunk-streaming-client-traps for what happens when a worker does.
##
## ## Sidecars: textures that stay VRAM-compressed
##
## Decoded, every map image is RGBA8 on the GPU (4 bytes a pixel and a third
## more for mips): a dressed hub held 460-600 MiB of them against a 256 MiB
## chunk budget. The package therefore carries, beside each directory of
## shared images, a `vram/` folder made by tools/build_vram_textures.py:
## `<sha>.<recipe>.evt` (a 16-byte EVT1 header and a zstd frame holding a DDS
## with its whole mip chain, already BC7 / BC5 / BC1) and `index.json`. When
## the renderer can sample a sidecar's format, the image is that sidecar,
## uploaded as it is: no decode, no mips to build, a quarter (BC7, BC5) or an
## eighth (BC1) of the memory. Any doubt - no index, a schema or recipe
## version this client does not know, a missing or corrupt file, a size or
## format that disagrees with the index, a format the GPU lacks, a material
## role the sidecar was not encoded for (an index older than the maps) - and
## that image is decoded from its JPEG/PNG as before, so a package without
## sidecars (a dev checkout that never ran the tool) behaves exactly as
## develop did.
##
## The client never compresses anything itself: the export templates have no
## BC encoder (tests/test_build_vram_textures.py holds that line).
##
## Everything here is static: the extension instance is shared by every import
## running at once (the main thread's primed cells, a chunk worker, neighbour
## territories), so per-import state lives in the `GLTFState`.
