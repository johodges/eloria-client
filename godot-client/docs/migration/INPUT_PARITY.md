# Input parity baseline

The complete legacy `keys.c` audit is in progress. Names below are stable Godot actions; exact defaults must be copied only after resolving platform conditionals.

| Legacy behavior | Context | Godot action | Rebindable |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ground click / move | world | world_move | yes |
| Run modifier / run-to | world | world_run | yes |
| Rotate camera | world | camera_rotate | yes |
| Zoom | world | camera_zoom_in/out | yes |
| Select / context action | world | select / interact | yes |
| Attack | world | attack | yes |
| Focus chat / submit | HUD | chat_focus / chat_submit | yes |
| Full map | HUD | toggle_map | yes |
| Inventory | HUD | toggle_inventory | yes |
| Magic | HUD | toggle_magic | yes |
| Manufacture | HUD | toggle_manufacture | yes |
| Escape / cancel | global | cancel | yes |
| Sit / stand (Alt+S) | world | toggle_sit | yes |
| Screenshot | global | screenshot | yes |
| Fullscreen | global | toggle_fullscreen | yes |

World input must be suppressed when a Control consumes the pointer event. Debug bindings exist only in development builds.

## Implemented gameplay shell controls

| Gesture | Result |
|---|---|
| Left click on world | Convert Godot ground point to server tile and send MOVE_TO |
| Left click on minimap / full map | Project through that map camera and send MOVE_TO |
| Shift + left click | Send RUN_TO |
| Right-button drag | Orbit yaw and pitch |
| Middle-button drag | Pan focus offset |
| Mouse wheel | Zoom with configured limits |
| Tab | Toggle full map using the minimap render |
| Alt+S | Send the authoritative desired sit/stand state |
| T / Enter | Focus chat; Enter submits RAW_TEXT |
| Click NPC | Select actor and send TOUCH_PLAYER |

The full-screen `SubViewportContainer` owns world mouse input through its `gui_input`
signal. HUD controls render above it and consume their own events, preventing click-through.
This explicit route is required because mouse events delivered to an embedded viewport are
not guaranteed to reappear in the root Control's `_unhandled_input()` callback.

The camera focus is updated every rendered frame from the local actor's presentation
transform. Server reconciliation, interpolation, and terrain-height projection therefore
cannot leave the camera at a stale position. Focus updates preserve yaw, pitch, zoom, and
the explicit user pan offset.

## Binding resolution

Every keyboard binding is resolved through the InputMap. `main.gd` contains no
raw keycode comparison for a bound action: `_input()` delegates to
`_handle_bound_action()`, which is a list of `is_action_pressed()` branches, and
`_unhandled_input()` owns the gameplay actions a focused control is allowed to
swallow. Before this, `toggle_inventory`, `turn_left` and `turn_right` were
declared as actions but resolved by keycode, so rebinding them appeared to work
and changed nothing, and `toggle_map`, `toggle_minimap` and `toggle_console`
were resolved twice - once by keycode and once by action.

`_handle_bound_action()` returns early while a `LineEdit` or `TextEdit` has
focus. Several actions default to bare printable keys, so without that a
backtick typed into chat would open the console at the same time, and `Ctrl+C`
would connect instead of copying. `cancel` is the one exception: it still
dismisses the chat entry from a focused field.

| Action | Default | Handler |
|---|---|---|
| `connect` | Ctrl+C | `_on_connect_pressed()` - available before the world exists |
| `disconnect` | Ctrl+D | `_on_disconnect_pressed()` - the action shipped with an empty event list and no handler |
| `toggle_inventory` | Ctrl+I | `_on_inventory_button_pressed()` |
| `toggle_map` | Tab | `_toggle_full_map()` |
| `toggle_minimap` | Alt+M | `_toggle_minimap()` |
| `toggle_console` | ` | `_toggle_console()` |
| `recenter_viewport` | Space | `_recenter_viewport_on_player()` |
| `turn_left` / `turn_right` | Q / E | `_turn_local_actor()` |

`connect` keeps its declared Ctrl+C default, which collides with copy on any
focused text surface other than a `LineEdit`/`TextEdit`. The rebinding UI in
Phase 3.3 is where a player resolves that; it is recorded here rather than
silently changed.
