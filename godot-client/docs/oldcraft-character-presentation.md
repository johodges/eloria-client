# Oldcraft-inspired character presentation

This pass translates the readable fantasy shape language of the supplied
World of Oldcraft reference into Eloria's existing assets. It does not copy
Oldcraft meshes, textures, UI sprites, or animation data. The reusable cues
are broad heroic silhouettes, oversized readable extremities, matte painted
surfaces, warm-brass/oxblood entry UI, and a strongly lit live hero preview.

## Runtime character contract

Eloria's canonical player rig remains the source of truth:

- Keep the 77 joint names, order, parent hierarchy, rest transforms, and
  inverse bind poses stable.
- Keep gameplay displacement code-owned. Animation root motion remains off.
- Body, skinned hair, and modular garments must bind to the same canonical
  skeleton. Rigid equipment remains on named sockets.
- Do not author scale tracks into shared animation clips. The presentation
  layer uses persistent bone pose scales for chest, limbs, head, hands, and
  feet; scale animation would fight that layer every frame.
- Retain culture-specific silhouettes. Heavy cultures receive more trunk and
  extremity mass, while tall or spectral cultures keep their long-limbed read.
- Require an explicit player-culture profile before applying pose scales.
  Creatures and other NPC rigs remain untouched even when they reuse names
  such as `Head`, `hand_l`, or `thigh_l`.
- Continue using equipment fit variants where a silhouette cannot be reached
  by a uniform fit. Covered body zones should remain hidden to avoid clipping
  and unnecessary overdraw.

`OldcraftActorStyle` applies this contract once after the native skeleton is
loaded. It never changes the rest rig or inverse binds, so rebound equipment
inherits the same silhouette. Its material pass retains authored texture,
tint, transparency, emission, metal masks, and normal textures while
softening plastic-looking highlights with a roughness floor, restrained
dielectric specular, and a bounded normal-map strength.

## Source-model intake contract

The canonical 77-joint Eloria rig remains the only runtime player rig. For the
supplied female reference set, the separated high-poly model is the authority
for proportions, component boundaries, and equipment fit. A low-poly model may
donate geometry or LODs offline only after its UVs and materials are preserved
or cleanly rebaked and its skin is transferred to the canonical skeleton.
Mixamo rigs and animation clips are import/alignment references, never runtime
retargeting sources.

Preferred future source packages provide the exact canonical rest pose,
separated body and wardrobe components, clean UVs with base-colour and normal
textures, no more than four joint weights per vertex, and one material per
piece. Target 18–22k body triangles plus 3–4k hair for High, 8–12k plus 1–2k
hair for Medium, and 3–6k silhouette-preserving body triangles for Low. Fit,
skin transfer, and LOD conversion are baked and validated offline, avoiding
any added per-actor runtime cost.

## Player-selectable character quality

The existing Graphics Quality setting now also controls actor presentation.
Imported Godot scenes provide generated mesh LOD index chains; the runtime
cache shares those meshes, skins, and materials across actors.

| Setting | Mesh selection | Actor shadows | Remote cape cloth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low | LOD transitions at 0.35× authored bias | Off | Off |
| Medium | LOD transitions at 0.65× authored bias | Authored setting | Off |
| High | Authored LOD bias | Authored setting | On |

The local player's cape remains available at every tier. Existing crowd rules
remain in force as well: nearby actors animate at full rate, farther visible
actors update at half rate, off-screen animation pauses, and actors outside the
draw radius are hidden. Changing quality is live and does not re-import or
duplicate actor resources.

When torso coverage rebuilds a body surface, it filters every imported LOD
index chain through the same face predicate as the full-detail surface. This
keeps Low/Medium/High selection intact without adding a quality-specific mesh
cache or any per-frame geometry work.

The generated LOD chains are reached through `GlbSceneCache`'s imported-scene
route, which only an editor checkout takes. An exported client has no resource
path: `ProjectSettings.globalize_path("res://assets/...")` returns a path
relative to the game folder, `localize_path()` cannot map it back to `res://`,
and every actor glTF is parsed from its loose file with `GLTFDocument`, as it
was before this work. Packaged clients therefore ship the actor glTF files
loose only and the face masks (the actor files the client `load()`s) in the
PCK only. The textures the equipment glTFs name by relative URI ship in the
PCK too: `GLTFDocument` asks `ResourceLoader` for an external image before it
reads the file, a relative path resolves to `res://`, and the packager writes
their import settings (VRAM-compressed, mipmapped), so packaged equipment
uploads the imported textures rather than decoding each JPEG without mips.
Actor images nothing names (the editor's extracted copies of embedded glTF
images, the race and neck texture sources) are left out of a package; one
that any other shipped text names (data, scenes, map manifests) ships loose.
`GLTFDocument` reads each imported texture back with `get_image()`, a
RenderingServer call that a worker thread can only make by waiting for the
main thread, so equipment glTFs are parsed on the main thread only, never in
`NativeAnimationImporter.prewarm` or a map preloader's `GlbSceneCache.prepare`. A
packaged actor still carries no LOD chains, so Low and Medium change
shadows, cape simulation and LOD bias but not mesh detail there. Giving
packages the LODs needs the runtime to resolve those paths back to `res://`
(and the packager to ship the imported scenes instead of the loose GLBs).

Anything pinned to a mesh's bytes must therefore pin the parsed mesh too. The
importer lays out each face's corners differently from `GLTFDocument`, so a
fingerprint taken from the imported scene does not match the raw parse. The
Orun male's reviewed rear-neck face mask pinned both until the race rebase
rebuilt every race body on the Human body; it was retired with that rebuild.
`TorsoBodyCover` now pins no face list: a race's shared-neck bridge takes the
same face test as the rest of the body, apart from its throat
(`FRONT_BRIDGE_MIN_WEIGHT`), so the body below the bridge is cut exactly like
the Human's on either route. That rule finds the bridge by its material name,
"Shared neck bridge"; `tests/test_torso_body_cover_lods.gd` builds a rebased
female through `_build_raw`, the route a package takes, and requires the
same cut as the imported scene.

For future authored assets, use the following review targets rather than
adding more runtime modifiers:

- High: 18–22k body triangles plus 3–4k hair, normal map, local shadows.
- Medium: 8–12k body triangles plus 1–2k hair, 30 Hz distant animation.
- Low: 3–6k silhouette-preserving body, simplified or baked hair, 512–1024
  textures, 10–15 Hz distant animation.
- Prefer one material per visible piece and no more than four visible actor
  submissions on High. A future baked crowd representation can target two on
  Medium and one on Low without changing the gameplay actor contract.

## Entry-screen contract

Login and character creation keep Eloria's identity but use the reference's
visual hierarchy:

- dark carved-stone framing (`#1E1E22` / `#333338`),
- brass edging (`#F4C542` / `#B88A3B`),
- oxblood actions (`#8E1B12`, `#B82B1A` on hover),
- warm text (`#F5F0E0`), and
- a cool moonlit preview with a warm key, teal rim, and stone/brass pedestal.

The login remains lightweight procedural UI over Eloria's existing painted
world image. Character creation uses one original 1920×1080 painted stage, one
512×128 four-icon atlas, one live 3D actor, a stone class rail, and a parchment
form. The SubViewport has a transparent background so the actor reads as part
of the painting instead of inside a black box. No extra actors or animated
scenery are created, and the existing viewport gate disables preview rendering
as soon as character creation is hidden. The two UI textures are not referenced
by gameplay scenes.

## Creation class and starter-item contract

Creation offers four open-ended starting callings: Vanguard (`0`), Ranger
(`1`), Arcanist (`2`), and Warden (`3`). The calling is independent of the
selected race and sex. It grants an initial inventory but never restricts
attributes, skills, equipment, or later progression.

The server-owned starter grants are intentionally light enough to leave room
for tutorial rewards: Vanguard gets a militia sword, round shield, guard cape
and Studded Jack; Ranger gets an Amberwood longbow, 20 arrows and Scout Vest;
Arcanist gets an arcane focus wand, Warded Tabard and three mana potions; and
Warden gets a fighting quarterstaff, Furtrim Coat and leaf cape. The live
preview combines those starter pieces with each race's native lower wardrobe
to communicate a coherent class silhouette; the adjacent text names the items
actually granted.

The legacy `CREATE_CHAR` payload keeps its original eight appearance bytes in
the original order. Eloria appends one `class_id` byte after them. Updated
servers validate that byte against their own immutable starter-kit table and
select inventory using only the class id; `actor_type` remains a separate
visual choice. A missing ninth byte defaults to Vanguard, which keeps old
clients valid, and legacy servers ignore the trailing byte.

The client class table owns only presentation: label, description, icon key,
and representative equipment visual ids. The server owns the actual item
names and quantities. Switching race rebuilds the same selected loadout on the
new body. Players can temporarily hide class gear to inspect hair and wardrobe
colours without changing the selected class or the items creation will grant.

The reviewed class-equipment geometry is reproducible with
`eloria-assets/tools/revise_class_equipment_fit.py`. It consumes an explicit,
unmodified packed baseline plus the fresh canonical torso-refit output, writes
only to a new review directory, and refuses to install anything. The finalizer
preserves packed GLB metadata, materials, UVs, skinning, and draw counts. Its
torso path performs an audited reference-topology rebuild that removes hidden,
oversized upper-arm faces, while the Arcanist leg/boot cuff path changes only
POSITION/NORMAL accessors and preserves topology. Its orientation gate rejects
folded or newly degenerate triangles before a candidate can be reviewed in-client.
`eloria-assets/qa/class-equipment-fit-baseline.json` pins every baseline,
torso-reference, rig, and accepted-output SHA-256. All input validation
completes before the output directory is created, so a prior result cannot be
double-baked. Each generated GLB is then required to match its accepted-output
hash.

To reproduce the inputs in a clean build-kit checkout, extract
`sourceGitPath` at `sourceGitCommit` and the two luminous body GLBs under
`anatomyGitPath` at `anatomyGitCommit`, using the exact revisions recorded in
that manifest. Run `build_class_equipment_fit_references.py` with `--anatomy`
and a fresh `--output` to rebuild and hash-check the eight torso references
from the existing local authoring sources; it performs no network or generation
call. Then pass the extracted packed baseline and the printed reference root to
`revise_class_equipment_fit.py`. Every external texture is content-addressed,
verified before output creation, and included in the final provenance report.

## Asset-generation decision

No new generated mesh was required for this pass. The existing canonical
bodies and modular equipment can carry the target silhouette through their
shared rig, so no external generation credits were consumed.
