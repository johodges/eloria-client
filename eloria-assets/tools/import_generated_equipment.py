"""Take the generated armour set into the client and the server, in one pass.

Added 2026-09-01 for Eloria Client.

``conform_equipment`` turns one generated mesh into one wearable GLB.  This is
the other half: which sixty meshes, what each of them is, where its geometry
lands, and the two halves of the definition that make it a thing a player can
own.  A wearable is not one record but four, joined only by the item's name --

  the mesh          godot-client/assets/actors/native/equipment/<slug>.glb
  the client entry  godot-client/data/actors/equipment.json, models["part:id"]
  the server item   dev-server/config/eloria/items.txt, an [item] block
  the server visual dev-server/eloria/items.py, EQUIPMENT_VISUAL_OVERRIDES

-- and a set added to one side and not the other is either armour that draws
nothing or geometry nobody can wear.  All four are written here so they cannot
drift apart.

  python import_generated_equipment.py                 build and write
  python import_generated_equipment.py --dry-run       say what would change
  python import_generated_equipment.py --sheet arcane_ethereal

Idempotent.  The server blocks are fenced by markers and rewritten whole; the
client entries are merged into the registry by key, so the authored models
around them are left alone rather than regenerated.
