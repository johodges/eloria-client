"""Define the potion shelf and paint each bottle its own icon.

Added 2026-09-02 for Eloria Client.

The server's potion effects are keyed by item name (dev-server
eloria/potions.py), so a profile without items of those names has working
potion machinery and nothing to drink.  This tool is the potion counterpart
of ``import_generated_equipment``: one roster that owns both halves of every
potion --

  the server item   dev-server/config/eloria/items.txt, an [item] block
  the icon pixels   painted here, packed by tools/build_item_icon_atlases.py

-- so the names the effects bind to, the ids the client draws by, and the
bottles the player tells apart are decided in one place.

There are no meshes to render: a potion's icon is painted, the way
``paint_material_icons`` paints the harvestables.  Every bottle is drawn from
its effect: red for health and blue for ether, a smaller vial for a smaller
draught and a full flask for a greater one, tall bottles for the practice
(skill) draughts, round-bellied flasks for the attribute tonics, stoppered
square bottles with a warded glow for the resistances, and a jug for the meal
in a bottle.  Shape, size, colour and trim never repeat as a set, so no two
icons read alike in the bag.

  python potion_icons.py                 write the server items
  python potion_icons.py --dry-run       say what would change
  python potion_icons.py --preview DIR   also save each icon as a PNG

Idempotent, like its siblings: the server block is marker-fenced and
rewritten whole.
