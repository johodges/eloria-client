"""Split a race body's fused mesh into the named appearance surfaces.

The runtime's appearance system tints and toggles by mesh-node name --
``body``, ``eyes``, ``hair``, ``wardrobe_shirt``, ``wardrobe_pants``,
``wardrobe_boots`` -- but the luminous bodies ship as one fused primitive
called ``char1``, so the skin, eye and head options match nothing, the
built-in hair cannot be hidden under a chosen style, and the painted
outfit cannot be recoloured.

The split shares every vertex attribute: each surface becomes its own
mesh node carrying the SAME position/normal/uv/skin accessors and only
its own index buffer, so the geometry is bit-identical and the fitter's
measurements do not move.  Faces are classified by the texel under their
UV centroid plus height priors.  The wardrobe surfaces get a grayscale
copy of the texture so the runtime's albedo colour multiplies into true
cloth colours; a plain band and cap are generated for the head styles
the runtime already knows how to toggle.

    -- not a small handful of deliberate hard edges among otherwise-smooth

    each; eyes by geometry.

    The original version thresholded absolute Y and a "teal" hue tuned to
    one body's blue-green shirt -- and both assumptions broke on the
    common-skeleton redraw art (Luminous Human, and the races still to
    come on the same skeleton): the male shirt here is off-white, not
    teal, and a garment's OWN height range is not a narrow band -- a
    sleeve runs from the shoulder down past the hip, overlapping pants'
    Y range while still being shirt-coloured.  A first version that kept
    Y as the classifier (proportional this time, not absolute) still put
    every sleeve and cuff in "body" for exactly that reason: the sleeve's
    centroids scatter across the whole torso-to-hip range, and no single
    band contains them.

    What generalises across both colour schemes AND that shape problem is
    colour distance to a small set of reference colours -- but sampled
    from THIS body, not hard-coded, because the palette differs per race.
    Each reference is the median texel colour in the middle of a Y-band
    that is unambiguous by construction (boots at the ankle, pants at
    mid-thigh, shirt at mid-chest, skin at the crown of the head, all
    picked well clear of any seam); every face then goes to whichever
    reference it is nearest, with no Y restriction on the match itself,
    so a shirt-coloured sleeve at hip height still reads as shirt.

    Eyes are a handful of triangles on a body this low-poly, and "most
    forward" geometry alone does not find them: sweeping the most-forward
    Z across fine Y slices up the face finds one continuous ridge (nose
    tip, then brow), centred on X in every slice -- this low-poly a
    sculpt has no eye socket concavity distinguishing eyes from the nose
    or brow ridge, so "forward-facing" just picks whichever of those a
    Y-band happens to contain, which is how a first version coloured half
    the face.  What does hold, measured on both Luminous Human bodies:
    eyes sit ABOVE the nose tip -- the actual most-forward point of the
    head, found by that same Y-sweep -- as two lobes symmetric about the
    face's own centreline.  Anthropometric, not discovered per body, but
    expressed as a fraction of THIS head's own vertical span so it scales
    with head size rather than assuming one body's absolute measurements.

    That geometric zone is only a coarse net, though: checked directly
    (Godot's own import preview, isolating the "eyes" primitive) there
    IS a real painted eye -- iris, pupil, sclera -- sitting in a small
    UV island, but most of the zone's triangles are the plain-skin eyelid
    and brow around it, so classifying the whole zone as "eyes" pulled in
    far more skin than eye.  What separates the two within the zone is
    colour: the painted eye is nowhere near this body's skin tone, while
    the surrounding eyelid triangles ARE that skin tone almost by
    definition. So the zone is sampled for its own local skin reference
    (median of everything in it, since skin is the overwhelming
    majority) and only the zone's outliers -- far enough from that local
    reference -- keep the "eyes" label; the rest fall back to "body".

    That colour outlier test still keeps a few triangles that are far
    from skin for an unrelated reason -- a UV chart border sampled at the
    face centroid, a stray fold catching a highlight -- and, checked
    directly by tinting the classified "eyes" primitive a saturated
    colour in the live creation preview, those show up as small jagged
    wedges disconnected from the eye itself, not touching it at any
    shared vertex. The real eye is one connected patch of geometry (per
    side), so the fix is connectivity, not a better colour rule: group
    the colour-selected triangles by shared position into left/right
    sides, keep only the largest connected piece on each side, and
    return the rest to "body". Measured on both Luminous Human bodies,
    the true eye is always the largest piece by a wide margin -- the
    female zone's outliers split into two 47-48 triangle eyes plus eight
    fragments of 8 or fewer.

    the exact same screen positions with or without any of this -- not

    [floor, 1.0] rather than [0.0, 1.0], which keeps a lit fabric looking
    like fabric instead of a flat colour swatch without also making a
    dark source garment crush to black once tinted.  The shading itself
    is addressed separately, in replicated_actor_3d.gd, the same way
