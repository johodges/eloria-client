"""Sixty-four boots, authored from concept art, built on the measured body.

Footwear used to be one lofted shell dressed as twenty catalogue entries.  This
builds each design as its own mesh: a base shell measured off the real foot, and
a stack of layers - plates, straps, cuffs, wraps, reliefs, ornaments - that carry
the silhouette of the sheet it came from.

Three things here are load-bearing and none of them is decoration.

**Skin scope.**  A boot is refitted per wearer by scaling each bone about *its
own origin*, and ``calf``'s origin is the knee.  A sole vertex that inherits the
body's own heel weighting - which is 31 per cent ``calf`` - is dragged 62 mm
under the floor on an Orun.  The foot shell and its sole are therefore scoped to
the foot chain and the shaft keeps the calf, so each part of the boot is
refitted against the part of the leg it sits on.

**Ground pre-compensation.**  The runtime now scales the foot chain by the
wearer's own ankle-to-sole distance (see ``soleDrop`` in the registry), which is
what lets one sole stand on sixteen different floors.  That scale can *shrink* a
boot - the female rigs are twenty per cent shorter from ankle to sole - so the
shell is measured against each cast body's foot divided by the shrink it will
receive.  Sized to the reference foot alone it would close inside a smaller one.

**Closure.**  Every element is a closed solid.  Open sheets have no inside, so
the enclosure test cannot use them and the winding test cannot check them; a
strap that is a closed band costs a few triangles and is measurable.  Winding is
settled at the end by ``face_outward``, which flips any closed component that
encloses negative volume - the failure that once made a closed boot render as an
open-toed sandal with the foot inside it.

    Rewritten 2026-08-29 for Eloria Client.  The spine used to be constructed
    from the bones - a heel point placed back along the ankle-to-ball axis, then
    seated onto whatever flesh lay under it.  Back along that axis is *up*: the
    ball sits below and in front of the ankle, so the constructed heel landed
    12 cm in the air behind the ankle bone, and the flesh search then found the
    ankle rather than the heel and seated it there.  The result was a boot with
    no heel under it at all, its sole touching the ground only from the arch
    forward.

    Each station is now measured straight off the foot: walk the flesh along
    whichever axis the foot actually runs, take the slab at each step, and size
    the ring to that slab's own extent.  That describes a plantigrade foot and a
    digitigrade one equally well, because it never assumes which way either of
    them points.

    ``cast`` is every other foot in the fit group, already carried back into
    this rig's authored space through the refit that wearer will receive.  A
    shell solved against the authored foot alone fits the authored foot alone:
    an Orun's is twelve per cent wider and a Stoneborn's sixteen, and the
    runtime's widening is one number for a whole bone rather than a shape.
    Solving against all of them at once is what makes one authored mesh
    genuinely contain fourteen different feet.

    ``ground_shrink`` survives as a knob but is 1.0 in practice: the runtime
    seats footwear on the ground by moving it rather than by resizing it, so a
    shell no longer has to be built oversize against a shrink it will never
    receive.  Measured across the cast the foot itself barely varies - every
    female foot is within four per cent of its male counterpart's width - so
