"""Split the generated leg pieces that came with feet into legs and boots.

Added 2026-09-06 for Eloria Client.

Legs and feet are separate slots, so a leg piece owns the body from the waist
to the ankle and nothing below it.  One of the eight generated leg sheets
disagrees: every design on ``Eight_legendary_fantasy_leg_armor_designs`` was
drawn -- and generated -- as a full harness ending in an armoured boot, so
its eight leg pieces (``Phoenix Legguards`` through ``Lion Legguards``) each
ship a pair of sabatons that a player wearing boots would be wearing twice.

**Which sheets, and how that was settled.**  A foot is the one part of a leg
piece that reaches *forward* past the shin above it, so the side silhouette
says it plainly.  Measured against the six real boot sheets as a control, the
bottom slab of a boot is about twice as deep as the column above it; of the
eight leg sheets only the legendary one reads that way, on all eight of its
designs, and the rendered silhouettes agree -- legendary shows the boot
control's L-shaped foot and the other seven end flat at the ankle.

That measurement is *not* what selects a sheet here.  Taken as a threshold it
does not separate cleanly: a flared trouser cuff on the militia sheet reaches
almost as far forward as the shallowest legendary sabaton, and trimming a cuff
because it flared would quietly restyle a design nobody complained about.  The
sheets are therefore named below after looking at them, which is the same
bargain ``import_generated_equipment.SHEETS`` makes -- what a piece *is* is
authored, and only its geometry is measured.

The ankle is still measured, per design, and reported: walking up the forward
profile from the floor, the toe's reach falls away and settles at the shin's own
minimum, between 11% and 19% of each mesh's height.  It is the evidence that a
foot is there at all.  It is no longer where the cut goes -- see below.

The cut is left open, like every other edge in this set: these are generated
shells with hundreds of boundary edges already, and the two new edges meet each
other exactly, so whichever piece is missing the other's edge is a hem.

**The feet are kept, not thrown away.**  They are the only armoured boots in
the set drawn to match one specific pair of legs, so each one is written out as
its own generated source under the boot sheet named in ``BOOTED_SHEETS``, and
picked up from there by ``import_generated_equipment`` like any other sheet.

**One cut, at ``BOOT_SHARE``, serves both.**  Everything above it is legwear and
everything below it is the boot, so no detail is on both and none is lost.  The
legs are therefore hemmed at the boot's rim rather than at the ankle, and a
player wearing no boots shows bare shin below it -- which is the trade, and the
one our user asked for, because the alternative is the sabaton's cuff riding
the leg armour and being worn twice over when the boots go on.  The legs are
seated against that hem too: see ``SHEET_SPAN`` in the importer.

Only ``<piece>.glb`` is rewritten.  ``<piece>.glb.orig`` is the raw generator
export and stays as it is -- it is what marks a source as preprocessed for
``import_generated_equipment.roster`` and what the icon renderer prefers -- and
the pre-trim ``.glb`` is kept beside it as ``.glb.booted``, which is both the
backup and where the boot is cut from once the legs no longer have one.  A
source that already has a ``.glb.booted`` is left alone, so the tool is
idempotent.

  python trim_generated_boots.py                  split, and say what moved
  python trim_generated_boots.py --dry-run        measure only
  python trim_generated_boots.py --restore        put the feet back on the legs

Then build both sheets.  The legs change geometry only, so their definitions
stay put; the boots are new items and need theirs written:

  python import_generated_equipment.py --sheet legendary_leg_armor --meshes-only
  python import_generated_equipment.py --sheet legendary_sabatons

#: This is deliberately *not* the ankle the legs are cut at.  A boot in this set
#: has a shaft: the leg hem lands at Y 0.184 and the boot reaches 0.320, so the
#: two overlap and the trouser tucks in.  Splitting the foot off at the ankle
#: instead gives a sabaton with no shaft, and `seat` -- which scales uniformly
#: to fill the region -- then has to double it to reach 0.320, which lands a
#: foot half again too big on the body.  Measured: x2.02 cut at the ankle
