"""Build the Godot-native Nymara actor library from clean glTF 2.0 sources.

This pipeline deliberately does not consume the legacy Cal3D humanoid or creature
generators.  Playable races retain the proven Quaternius 65-joint skin, topology,
weights, and animation bone names.  Creature meshes, rigs, and clips are authored
here from scratch.

Modified 2026-08-28 for Eloria Client: equipment is no longer a set of primitive
blobs bolted to a bone with an identity transform.  ``equipment_authoring``
lofts wearables around the measured body silhouette and skins them to the shared
rig, and authors props against a character-space socket solved from the rig
itself, so items attach at body scale and follow every animation clip.

# --- race anatomy ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# Every playable race shares the one 65-joint Quaternius rig so the universal
# animation library keeps working, but sharing a rig does not have to mean
# sharing a body.  The previous pass scaled the source mesh with three hard
# width bands keyed off absolute height (hips below 48%, shoulders to 78%,
# head above).  That produced a visible pinch at the waist and the neck, it
# stretched arms lengthwise instead of thickening them -- the bands multiply
# X, and an A-posed arm is almost entirely X -- and it left all eight races
# the same human silhouette with a small prop glued on.
#
# This pass retargets the rest pose instead.  Segment lengths and rest
# rotations move the joints, and the mesh follows through linear blend
# skinning with T = B . G . A^-1, where A is the source bind pose, B the
# retargeted bind pose, and G a girth scale expressed perpendicular to the
# bone.  Deformation is therefore smooth by construction (it is blended by
# the same skin weights the renderer uses), anatomically meaningful (a bone
# gets longer or thicker rather than a slab of world space getting wider),
# and it costs no extra vertices.
#
# Two invariants keep the shared animation library usable:
#
#   * hip-to-ground distance is preserved.  The clips write pelvis
#     translation directly, so a longer leg cannot raise the hips -- it would
#     push the feet through the floor.  After retargeting, the leg chain is
#     rescaled by a single solved factor that restores the original ground
#     contact height.  Races still differ in how the leg is *divided*, which
#     is what makes a digitigrade stance possible at all.
#   * overall stature rides on the model registry's import scale rather than
#     on the rig, so a taller race is uniformly taller instead of having its
#     hips detached from its feet.
#
# The rest of the runtime contract is untouched: 65 joints, the same joint
# names and order, one skin, and rest transforms that stay rigid so the
# clips' rotation tracks still mean what they meant before.

# pectoral or thin a forearm towards the wrist; turning it up further just
# made a shrunken heroic body.

# radial field: every vertex is scaled across the bone that drives it, by a
# factor that tapers along that bone and is further modulated by anatomical
# zones anchored to named joints, so it works on the male and female
# skeletons alike without a second set of coordinates.
#
# It runs on the source mesh in bind space, *before* the race retarget, and
# it never moves a vertex along its own bone.  Two consequences matter:
# garment cuts are still selected from the untouched source body, so no hem
# moves; and the rig -- hip height, ground contact, the solved leg chain -- is
# not involved at all, because this changes the mesh and not the skeleton.
