"""Build the sixty-four footwear designs, fitted against every race that wears them.

The shell is solved rather than padded.  Sizing a boot to the body it was
authored on fits that body; sizing it to a guess about the others fits nobody in
particular.  So each design is built, measured against every race in its fit
group with the same connected-component parity check the tests use, and any body
vertex still outside the shell is carried back into the authoring rig's own
space and added to what the next round has to contain.  Two or three rounds is
usually enough, and a design that will not converge says so rather than shipping.

Run with ``--only <slug>`` while iterating on one design; the default builds the
whole catalogue plus its saurian variants.
