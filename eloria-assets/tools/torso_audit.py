"""Measure every torso design on every race that wears it, in every pose.

Added 2026-08-29 for Eloria Client.  This is the exhaustive run behind the
summary in ``godot-client/tests/test_torso_coverage.py``, which samples one
design of each construction because the full sweep is minutes rather than
seconds.  Run it when the construction changes, and keep its report as the
evidence for what the set actually measures.

Reports the shoulder separately from the body total throughout.  A torso garment
claims eight hundred-odd vertices and the reported defect was a handful of them
at the deltoid; averaged into a whole-body figure it disappears, which is how it
survived being "fixed" more than once.
