"""Take the generated weapon and shield set into the client and the server.

Added 2026-09-02 for Eloria Client.

The sibling of ``import_generated_equipment`` for the things you hold rather
than wear.  Same four records, joined by the item's name --

  the mesh          godot-client/assets/actors/native/equipment/<slug>.glb
  the client entry  godot-client/data/actors/equipment.json, models["part:id"]
  the server item   dev-server/config/eloria/items.txt, an [item] block
  the server visual dev-server/eloria/items.py, EQUIPMENT_VISUAL_OVERRIDES

-- and the same rule that a set added to one side and not the other is either
a weapon that draws nothing or geometry nobody can hold.

Two things differ from the armour.  A prop is never skinned: parts 0 and 1
hang off ``hand_r`` and ``hand_l``, so these are plain static meshes and the
socket's own rotation lays them into the grip.  And a prop is not sized from
the body -- a sword is as long as a sword whoever swings it -- so each class
carries its own length, taken off the authored props in
``conform_equipment.PROP_KIND``.

``flip`` and ``roll`` are per item and are the two things that cannot be
derived.  Nothing in a mesh says which end is the tip: a guard is the widest
part of a sword and sits low, an axe head is the widest part of an axe and sits
high.  Nothing says which way a curved head hooks either.  Both are set by
looking at a render, the way lowpoly_rigged/models.json sets a donor's facing.

  python import_generated_weapons.py             build and write
  python import_generated_weapons.py --dry-run
  python import_generated_weapons.py --only sword
  python import_generated_weapons.py --only sword --skip-build --regrip

Each held weapon's grips are solved against every playable body and the
class kits (``held_grips``), which takes the best part of an hour for the set,
so they are cached by a digest of what they are solved from (``GRIP_CACHE``)
and a run with ``--only`` keeps the grips the other pieces already have.
``--regrip`` solves every piece afresh.

Idempotent, like its sibling: the server blocks are marker-fenced and rewritten
whole, the client entries merged into the registry by key.

#: right angle forward.  That one way had to serve two hands that are nothing
#: alike -- the fist the combat idle and every swing close round the hilt, and
#: the open hand of the standing idle hanging by the thigh -- and it served
#: neither.  It was solved before the library idle changed (2026-09-07), so in
#: the idle the client stands in every blade pointed forward like a lance, 32
#: degrees out to the right; and no single rotation can be right for both,
#: because the blade that hangs down the leg at ease is the blade that the
#: wind-up of Combat_Slash_A buries 0.4 m in the floor.  So a held weapon now
#: carries two grips, both solved here from the piece itself:
#:
#:   socket       the fighting grip, the one the fist was animated around --
#:                ``fighting_grip``
#:   idleSocket   how it is held at ease, which WeaponCarryPose blends to while
#:                the actor idles or turns on the spot (which is also what the
#:                creation screen plays) -- ``idle_grip``
#:
#: and walking and running keep pointing it ahead through WeaponCarryPose, as
#: they did before.  "idleSocket" rather than "restSocket": everything else in
#: the registry and the runtime that says rest means the bone rest the socket is
#: resolved through.

#: The clip both grips are fitted to.  It can only be the one the client
#: idles in (data/animations/luminous.json maps "idle" and "turn" to it), and
#: it is sampled across its whole loop, because the hand drifts a few degrees
#: over it and a planted butt drifts with it.  Every playable body shares one
#: skeleton and plays this clip unchanged, scaled whole by its model scale, so
#: a grip solved on one body is the same grip on every other.

#: Where the fist closes, as the character-space offset the class arming
#: sword's grip was reviewed at (467fe82f3), in the legacy units the props are

#: it towards the knuckles, in the tunnel the curled fingers make.  Every
#: weapon is held there -- the mesh is authored with its grip on the origin --

#: end of a planted or leant piece where it was set down.
#:
#: Modified 2026-10-06 for Eloria Client: bows hung like a blade.  A bow is

#: And the armour worn over them, as registry keys, each worn the way the
#: client fits it to every body (``_Worn``, ``_bodies_frames``).  Modified
#: 2026-10-06 for Eloria Client: the clearance used to stop at the bare body
#: and its default clothes, trusting ``BODY_CLEARANCE`` to leave room for
#: armour, and it did not -- measured in the client, the planted spears and
#: polearms ran 3-5 cm up inside the Studded Jack's sleeve in every idle frame
#: on every race, a greatsword's hilt end went into its hem, the bowblade's
#: upper limb and the chain morningstar's handle up its sleeve, and the
#: Warden's quarterstaff into the Furtrim Coat.  So the torso, legs and boots
#: of each creation class kit are cleared as surfaces of their own: every
#: player starts in one of them, and between them they are the bulkiest a body
#: is drawn in at the shin, the hem, the sleeve and the shoulder.
#:
#: And their capes.  Modified 2026-10-06 for Eloria Client: the Vanguard and
#: the Warden each start in one, and the set stopped at the boots, so nothing
#: kept a piece out of the cape -- the bows rested with the upper limb back
#: through it, and a hand crossbow, a shield spear, the chain weapons and a
#: chakram sat 3.5-5 cm inside it.  Both kits wear the one generic cape, so
#: one fit of it clears both (``_Worn.signature``).  A cape is a sheet drawn
#: from both sides, which ``_Worn.sheet`` handles.

)

#: How finely worn armour is sampled for that.  Its shells are a few thousand
#: vertices spread over a whole boot or jacket, too far apart for a nearest-
#: vertex distance to see a haft pass between them, so each triangle is halved
#: until no edge is longer than this, leaving no point of a shell more than a
#: centimetre and a bit from a sample (``_surface_samples``).
WORN_SPACING = .02

#: Worn armour is cleared by which side of its shell a point is on, which the
#: shell's own normals say (``_Frame.clearance``): a point this far behind the
#: nearest sample of it, within ``WORN_REACH`` of it, is inside the piece --
#: a centimetre, about what the sampled shell resolves (``WORN_SPACING``).
#: Unsigned, as the body is cleared, a pommel or a butt sunk a few centimetres
#: into a jacket hem or a boot is still only a centimetre or two from the
#: nearest point of the shell -- or of the body beneath it -- and passes for
#: clear: the planted butts measured 3-5 cm inside the Banded Warboots in the
#: client while the unsigned check here had them clear of everything.  And it
#: is only being inside that counts against a piece, not coming near: the
#: margins that keep a blade off the skin would keep it a hand's width off a
#: coat that flares at the hip where the hand already rests, and nothing held
#: in that hand can do that.
WORN_INSIDE = .01
WORN_REACH = .04

#: Except round the wrist of the hand that holds the piece.  A cuff closes
#: there -- the Furtrim Coat's fur, the Acolyte Tunic's bell, which hangs a
#: hand's width up the forearm -- and a pommel or a haft run up against the
#: wrist is inside it whichever way the piece leans: measured, every slant of
#: the arming sword left its pommel 1-4 cm inside one cuff or the other, and
#: every lean of a planted spear its haft 1-3 cm inside the bell, 13-18 cm
#: from the fist.  Up the sleeve beyond this, towards the elbow -- where the

#: And a leaning one, which rests its tip on the floor ahead of the foot and

FALLBACK_TOLERANCE = .01

#: Classes whose head hangs to one side of the haft, so that which side leads
#: the swing is a property of the mesh: the larger half of the head goes to the

#: closes on it (``ROLL_EXCEPTIONS`` settles the odd ones in the mesh).
HEADED = {"axe", "greataxe", "polearm"}

#: Pieces fought with a half turn about their own length from the way the

#: in Combat_Slash_B, and the twin glaive both its blades -- 0.10 m in the
#: Combat_Slash_A wind-up, 0.02 m in B.  Turned, measured in the client at 121
#: samples a swing, neither reaches the floor (bow +0.13/+0.18 m, glaive
#: +0.02/+0.08 m) and the bow touches the body in one combat-idle frame rather
#: than eight.  Settled by measuring and looking, like the flips.

#: The off hand.  Modified 2026-10-06 for Eloria Client.  Its piece used to be
#: solved like the right hand's and came out unlike it: the idle rests the
#: left hand on the thigh, about four centimetres nearer the leg than the
#: right, so the search swung every left-hand piece away from the leg --
#: a rondel dagger 43 degrees out beside its twin's 10 -- and a dual-wield
#: pair looked lopsided at rest.  Now a left-hand piece rests as the mirror
#: image of the same piece in the right hand, and the arm makes the room
#: instead: WeaponCarryPose holds it out from the body at ease by the first of
#: these spreads, in degrees, that clears the leg, the armour over it and the
#: cape, which the idle socket carries as ``"armSpread"`` -- or, where none
#: does, the least of those that come nearest.  Four degrees puts the left fist
#: where the right one hangs; the rest is the hip of the kit legguards, whose
#: fur and hems stand out over the left thigh a centimetre or two farther than
#: over the right.  Ten degrees takes the fist about eleven centimetres out.
OFFHAND_SPREADS = (0., 2., 4., 6., 8., 10.)

#: And the off hand's fist, which the combat idle raises beside the left
#: shoulder.  The fighting grip laid every left-hand blade back over it, 3-4 cm
#: into the Studded Jack's upper arm and collar on every body, where the old
#: single socket had cleared it.  So the left-hand fighting grip is turned
#: within the fist -- in the hand's own frame, about its X (towards the
#: knuckles) and its Y (towards the back of the hand), in degrees -- by the
#: least of these turns that clears ``FIGHTING_CLIP`` on every body and in
#: every class kit -- and of the turns that size that clear it, the one that
#: touches the body in fewest frames of the swings, which no grip keeps wholly
#: clear: the slashes carry the left hand across the chest.  Only that size:
#: let a larger turn win on a frame or two of a swing and sister pieces came
#: out held thirty degrees apart.

    ``sheet`` marks a cape.  Armour is a shell round the body, and which side
    of it a point is on is what its own normals say; a cape is a single sheet
    drawn from both faces, with half its normals turned in, so no four of

    under the cape, as a point under a jacket is inside it.

    Nor does a cape hang where its bind pose puts it.  The client's cloth
    (``cape_cloth.gd``) pushes the points its chains carry out of the torso
    and the legs and behind the plane of the back, and settled at rest it
    hangs about five centimetres farther back than it is bound -- the sides
    of the sheet at the hip 11-17 cm behind the hand rather than 4-13
    (measured in the client on a stoneborn in the Vanguard kit).  Left where
    it is bound, the sheet put every hilt held at the hip under it.  ``cloth``
    is each sample's share of the chains, which ``_bodies_frames`` moves back
