"""Does a garment actually contain the body inside it?

Skin poking through a garment is invisible in a wireframe, obvious on a player
and impossible to settle by eye at sixty-four designs, so it is measured here
instead.  For every body vertex under the garment the question is whether the
point lies inside the garment's shell, answered by ray-cast parity: a ray from
an enclosed point crosses a closed surface an odd number of times.

Nothing here is specific to footwear: a shell is a shell, and a trouser leg
poking a knee out through its side fails the same test a boot does.  Callers
scope *which* body vertices a piece is answerable for by passing a region.

**The trap this module exists to avoid.**  A garment is not one closed volume.
A boot's shaft and its foot shell are two overlapping closed volumes living in
a single glTF primitive, and a point inside *both* of them is crossed an even
number of times by any ray, so whole-primitive parity reports it as outside.
Run that way the shell this replaces reports a hundred and forty-two vertices
poking through when fourteen actually do.  Each primitive is therefore split
into connected components - union-find over edges welded by position - and a
point counts as enclosed when it is inside *any* closed component.  The same
applies to a trouser: two legs and a seat are three volumes, not one.
