"""Does a garment actually cover the body underneath it?

Added 2026-08-29 for Eloria Client.  Coverage used to be judged by looking at
it, which is how "there are still gaps in the shoulder areas of the shirt"
survived several rounds of fixing: a seam that closes in the T-pose the rig is
authored in opens the moment the arm leaves it, and a bind-pose screenshot
never shows that.

The measurement is enclosure by ray-cast parity - a body vertex is covered when
a ray leaving it crosses the garment an odd number of times - with two details
that decide whether the number means anything.

**Components, not primitives.**  A torso garment's body shell, its two sleeves
and its shoulder caps are separate closed volumes packed into one glTF
primitive.  Parity run over the whole primitive reports a point inside two of
them as *outside*, because it crosses an even number of faces.  Every primitive
is therefore split into connected components over position-welded edges, the
closed ones are kept, and a point counts as covered when it is inside **any** of
them.  The same mistake on the footwear reported 142 vertices poking through
where the real number was 14.

**The wearer's body, not the author's.**  A garment is authored once and refit
per race at runtime, so checking it against the rig it was built on proves
nothing about the fifteen other races that wear it.  ``refit`` reproduces the
runtime's own transform - the fit scale, the per-bone span ratio and the girth
widening from ``equipment.json`` - so the shell measured here is the shell the
player sees.

Poses come from the shared animation library and are applied to garment and
body alike, so a shoulder can be asked the only question that matters: is it
still closed at full abduction?

#: Vertices closer together than this are the same point.  Lofts emit each ring
#: twice where two surfaces meet, so without welding every seam reads as a
#: boundary and no shell is ever closed.

#: A body vertex is allowed to sit this far outside the garment before it counts
#: as showing through.  Zero would fail on floating-point noise at a seam the
#: garment shares with the skin it wraps.
SKIN_TOLERANCE = 2.0e-4

#: How much of a garment's own opening is excluded from what it is answerable
#: for, measured along the arm.
#:
#: A sleeve ends somewhere.  The ring of skin lying in the plane of that opening
#: is *at* the edge of the cloth, and whether it reads as inside or outside turns
#: on tenths of a millimetre once an elbow bends and slides the arm within the
#: sleeve.  Widening the cuff does not help: the opening moves out with it and
#: the same ring of skin arrives at the new rim.  Eight vertices on the back of
#: each forearm behaved exactly this way, at ``Jog`` and at no other clip.
#:
#: So the last centimetre of an opening is excluded, deliberately and in one
#: place rather than by quietly widening a tolerance.  It does not touch the
#: shoulder figure - the shoulder band is up against the torso, a long way
#: inboard of any cuff - and a garment that shrank away from the arm would show
#: it as a fall in ``checked``, not as a pass.
