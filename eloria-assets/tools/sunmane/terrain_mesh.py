"""Convert the sculpted landform into chunked, class-split render geometry.

Chunking keeps frustum culling and per-chunk collision useful; splitting each
chunk by terrain class lets the four described ground types tint the shared
detail texture without splat seams or a second UV set.

Every chunk node is named with the `Terrain_` prefix the client's world loader
uses to build navigation-surface collision, so grounding covers the whole
landform including the shallow shelf - an actor can never raycast into empty
space and fall back to the manifest walking height.
