"""Move a package's server-authority markers to where the server puts them.

A map package declares its harvest nodes and NPC markers twice: a `position`
in metres, which is where the client draws the thing, and a `serverTile`,
which is the tile the server runs it on. Entries marked `"authority":
"server"` say outright which of the two decides.

They can disagree. Some of these were authored on tiles the package's own walk
grid blocks - a harvest node a few tiles inside a building - so when the server
started enforcing that collision the node had to move, and the model it is
drawn as stayed behind. The four Four Gates harvestables were fixed this way
before, by hand, and `test_the_four_gates_harvestables_are_where_the_server_puts_them`
was written to hold the two together; this does the same for the rest.

    python eloria-assets/tools/sync_package_content.py [--manifest <path>] [--apply]

The manifest is the server's `config/eloria/client_content_manifest.json`,
which `dev-server/tools/relocate_map_content.py` keeps current. Position moves
with the tile: the horizontal part is exact, and the vertical part follows the
package's own terrain over the distance moved, so a node keeps whatever height
above the ground it was authored with.

The same tool also publishes the digest of each map package:

    python eloria-assets/tools/sync_package_content.py --digests [--apply]

The maps ship with the client, so the server cannot hand one over; what it can
do is say which package it was built against, and it does that by carrying a
`packageSha256` per map in the same manifest. The client hashes the package it
actually has - the same bytes, the same order, the same normalisation, because
this is the value its map cache is keyed on - and says so in the console if
the two disagree. That is all it does: a mismatch is a wrong install, not a
reason to distrust a cache that was keyed locally in the first place.
