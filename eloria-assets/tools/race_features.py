"""Race head features as their own mesh node (P4, lead decision 1).

Votary horns, the Stoneborn crown and Glasswarden crystals were part of the
v2 race head: mostly the scalp, partly the body race_head primitive (5-756
faces per body). rebase_race_body.build moves them into one mesh node,
`race_feature_head`:
  - one primitive, sourceRole `race_feature`, the race skin, 100% Head
    weights (the feature rows get their own copies);
  - a material per kind (MATERIALS) sampling the head atlas image, so no new
    texture; the head atlas packs and bakes the feature charts with the head;
  - the node is appended after every existing node, so the skin joints and
    the inverse-bind bytes stay identical.
Being a separate node it escapes the skin dye (replicated_actor_3d.gd has no
dye branch for it) and the runtime hides it under helms on its own.

The split runs after clean_head and before every texture step:
  segment  distance outside a skull ellipsoid fitted per head (eyes and the
           cranium behind the brow), seeded and grown over welded edges; the
           Glasswarden male also needs crystal colour (port of
           race_p47/features/seg2.py and v2/featinfo.py). Eyes, eyebrows and
           the rim band never join a feature.
  settle   feature components under FOLD_FACES faces go back to the head and
           head islands under FOLD_FACES faces the split leaves go into the
           feature (V6 and the CI fragment test want >= 20-face components).
  caps     every hole the split opens is closed by a cap WELDED to the hole
           boundary: the cap's boundary rows copy the position, normal and
           weights of the boundary rows (only the UV differs), the interior
           is a constrained Delaunay triangulation of the loop in a gnomonic
           projection about the skull (else the loop's best-fit plane, else a
           minimum-area triangulation), interior edges bisected to CAP_EDGE_M
           and lifted onto the skull ellipsoid plus a harmonic offset that
           meets the boundary. A cap joins the primitive that owns most of its
           hole's edges, a tie going to the body (cap_owner; R1 gave a mixed
           hole to the body, which left the Votary horn-root caps standing as
           domes through hide headwear); its triangles are appended LAST to
           that primitive (sharedBodyShape.raceFeatures.caps counts them), and
           it gets its own head-atlas chart: the hole edge's texels at its
           boundary, the local skin median inside.
  islands  (R2) head components the split or clean_head left floating (no rim
           face, no eye/eyebrow face) that lie on the caps of the head proper
           (median centroid distance under ISLAND_ON_CAP_M) are dropped with no
           caps of their own: kept, they doubled those caps (z-fighting); any
           other floating component keeps its faces and caps
           (raceFeatures.floatingIslands).
rebase_race_body.verify: V3 becomes head = v2 - cleanup - features - dropped
islands (caps set aside) and V20 (verify_features) checks the node, its
weights, material and v2 provenance, the caps (watertight, never above their
hole, each in the primitive owning most of its hole's edges) and that the
crown left in race_head/scalp is feature-free; rebase_race_body adds the
hide-state headwear check of the body caps (capHeadwear).
