"""Geometry for the sixty-four leg garments.

The silhouette is authored as a recipe and fitted procedurally: every design
names a kind and a handful of features, and the shapes below loft those onto
whichever rig is being built.  Sixty-four hand-modelled meshes would have to be
re-modelled for the saurian rig as well, and nothing in this project is authored
in a DCC tool, so the generator stays and grows a vocabulary instead.

Three structural shells carry the garment and every acceptance criterion that
matters is about them: a hip shell closed over the seat, and two leg tubes that
start *inside* it.  Everything else - tassets, kneecops, straps, panels, fur -
is decoration lofted over the top, and decoration is allowed to be an open band
because the winding test measures the mesh's total enclosed volume rather than
each piece's.

Three seams decide whether a leg garment works, and each has its own answer
here:

**Waist.**  The shirt spans Y 1.022-1.550 and is drawn outside the hip shell,
so a waistband at the old 1.055 was *underneath the shirt and invisible*; what
players read as the belt was a second belt the torso garment drew at 1.107, 30
mm above the top of the trousers.  Our user's ruling is that the legs get the
belt, so the torso piece drops its own and the waistband here is built to be
unambiguously the outer layer through the shared band: shell .020 proud of the
body against the shirt's .011, a waistband at .028 and a belt at .038.

**Seat.**  The hip shell reaches the crotch line and the leg tubes start above
it, so the two always overlap.  The band across the backside that the shell
used to leave bare is closed by construction rather than by tuning.

**Boot cuff.**  A ``pants`` hem lands at world Y .142 on the reference rig and
a ``legs`` hem at .178, both quoted to the footwear brief in world Y and as a
fraction of the thigh+calf chain, because the two pipelines parameterise
differently and bare fractions do not cross between them.
