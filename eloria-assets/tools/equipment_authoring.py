"""Body-conforming equipment authoring for the Nymara native actor library.

Added 2026-08-28 for Eloria Client.

The first equipment pass emitted small primitive blobs authored in an arbitrary
item space and attached them to raw ``BoneAttachment3D`` bones with an identity
transform.  That produced three defects the runtime could not correct:

* Bone rest bases are not axis aligned.  ``hand_r`` rests with its local +Y along
  world -X, so every weapon left the grip pointing sideways out of the body.
* The blobs were authored at three to five times body scale, so helmets, amulets
  and cuirasses engulfed the actor.
* Wearables were rigid children of a single bone, so a cuirass could not follow
  the spine and leg armour could not follow the knees.

This module authors equipment against the *measured* rest geometry of the shared
65-joint Quaternius rig.  Garments are lofted as offset shells around the real
body cross sections and are skinned to the same joints as the body, so they
deform with every clip in the universal animation library.  Rigid props keep a
socket, but the socket is now expressed in character space and the runtime
cancels the bone rest basis before applying it.

    scaling each bone about *its own origin*, which assumes the flesh sits in the
    same place relative to that origin on every rig.  For the foot it does not,
    in two independent ways:

      cast and only 78.6 to 83.4 mm on every female one, so a sole authored on
      one and scaled by stature onto the other lands 14 mm through the floor;
    * the Orun ankle sits 26 mm further inboard than the reference's, so their
      foot reaches 105 mm to the outside of the joint where the reference's
      reaches 72 - a shell cut to the reference and anchored on the joint simply
      misses the outer half of an Orun foot.

        replaces shipped enclosing negative volume.

        with each other by walking the adjacency graph and flipping any face
        that shares an edge in the same direction as its neighbour - on a
        manifold, neighbours traverse a shared edge in opposite directions.
        Then, if the agreed-upon orientation encloses negative volume, the whole
        component is flipped.  Components that enclose nothing are sheets and
        are left alone: they have no outside to face.

    Opt-in, through the ``chord`` flag on the ring builders, because it moves

    boot and cape pipelines are left exactly as they were rather than quietly
    resized by a change that is not about them.  It applies to them too and they
    should take it when they are next touched.

    Added 2026-08-29 for Eloria Client.  A ring is a polygon through points
    sampled *on* the surface it is measuring, so between two samples it cuts
    inside that surface by the sagitta of the chord - about a millimetre at
    24 sides on a forearm, which is exactly the margin a close-cut sleeve has.
    One vertex per side, at the sharpest point of the Luminous arm section, came
    through there and nowhere else.  Scaling each radius by 1/cos(pi/sides)
    circumscribes the sampled surface instead of inscribing it, so the flats
    clear it and the sample points sit proud rather than flush.

    This is the fix for the defect the whole rebuild exists to close: skin
    showing through at the shoulder.  Two things were wrong with the pad it
    replaces.

    It was *open* - a bare tube, capped at neither end - so it enclosed nothing,
    and the body shell and the sleeve had to meet it edge to edge across the
    deltoid.  Three open edges over a joint is three chances to part.

    And it was *blended*, taking its skin weights from the body underneath like
    every other garment vertex, which means part clavicle and part humerus.  The
    clavicle barely turns when an arm goes up, so a blended cap lags behind the
    arm it is covering and the seam opens exactly when the arm is raised - which
    is why the gap survived a bind-pose screenshot and still appeared in play.

    The cap here is a closed capsule swept about the humerus and pinned wholly
    to it, so it is rigid with respect to the joint it covers: at any arm angle
    it holds the same skin it held in the T-pose.  It reaches inboard far enough
    to sit inside the body shell and outboard far enough to sit inside the
    sleeve, so the three overlap as solids instead of meeting as edges.

    ``inboard`` and ``outboard`` are fractions of the humerus, measured from the
    shoulder joint.  ``swell`` is how much wider than the arm the cap runs, which
