# Crownwater regional QA

Crownwater now follows its concept's island-capital composition instead of the
generic regional ring: a pale central civic island connects to satellite
settlements through radial bridges and ferry approaches, with fishing and
patrol traffic occupying the surrounding turquoise water.

The layout includes eight civic towers, eight fountains, nine bridges, seven
ferry docks, six fishing boats, four patrol boats, six submerged waystones, and
six lake houses. Eight warm civic lights supplement the four transition lights.
Custom terrain separates the central island, satellite islands, causeways, and
deep water while keeping `(58,58)` clear.

```sh
python3 eloria-assets/tools/generate_nymara_complete.py build/eloria-data
python3 eloria-assets/tools/validate_generated_assets.py build/eloria-data
```

Validation asserts exact landmark counts, dependencies, scenery and lighting
density, all four terrain classes, water/land elevations, and arrival clearance.
Shaded client and map-editor captures remain pending a GPU-capable session.
