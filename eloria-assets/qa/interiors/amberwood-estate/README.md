# Amberwood Estate QA

Amberwood Estate now uses an authored manor layout instead of the shared
interior template. A formal entry leads through banquet rooms and residential
chambers into an overgrown memorial court, with a clear central route.

The layout contains 12 manor floors, 14 manor walls, six estate doors, four
banquet tables, six beds, and four overgrown statues. Eight warm interior lights
supplement the four transition lights. The `(58,10)` entrance, map identity, and
transition metadata remain unchanged.

```sh
python3 eloria-assets/tools/generate_nymara_complete.py build/eloria-data
python3 eloria-assets/tools/validate_generated_assets.py build/eloria-data
```

Validation asserts exact module counts, minimum scenery and lighting density,
dependency resolution, and a clear arrival radius. Shaded map-editor and client
captures remain pending a GPU-capable session.
