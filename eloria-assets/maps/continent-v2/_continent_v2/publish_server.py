"""publish_server.py: serve the continent-v2 isles from a server checkout: vendored grids, content overlay, manifest.

  python -B eloria-assets/maps/continent-v2/_continent_v2/publish_server.py --server <server checkout> \
         --bake sw_isle=<bake> --bake tollholms=<bake> --bake gull_skerries=<bake> --stage m1|m2|m3|m4 \

<bake> is each territory's region bake (the directory holding continent-authoring.json) of the committed scene: the
one its published package was made from (the package's provenance.snapshotSha256 and its collision block's
sourceSnapshotSha256 must be the bake's SHA-256, and the bake's scene SHA-256 the committed scene file's).

What it writes into --server (route B of the serve plan, section 2.3):

  config/eloria/client_content_manifest.json       the isles' maps[] entries and a continentV2 block, through the
                                                    legacy publisher's own serializer (publish_continent_geography.
                                                    json_bytes), then LF -> CRLF; refused unless re-serializing the

                                                    and continentGeography are never touched.
And into this checkout: _continent_v2/publication.json (--record), what was published from what, by SHA-256: isle
facts only (every file of every stage, the inputs' digests, row counts), the same whatever the server tree's base
tables, code or stage, so a server-only change never makes --check differ on the client's record.

--stage is the serve plan's milestone the server tree is at (section 5). m1 serves every overlay file except
questlines.txt (the inert landing.json, homes.json and home_npcs.txt included, as S5 lists them); m2 adds
questlines.txt (S14), and needs eloria/landing.py in the tree: before M2's quest_offers region gate and the chapter's
isle cast, the errands' givers stand only at Four Gates and would offer them there. m3 and m4 serve what m2 does and
need eloria/home.py as well. --apply removes an overlay file the stage does not serve; --check reports one.

Every coordinate comes from a scene marker or a content table's local metres, through frames.py; nothing is typed.
The ferry's landing is the destination's arrival as the legacy publication left it (the server's
eloria/continent_geography.py MAPS[<map>]['arrival'], which the client's legacy publisher writes), refused unless
every other copy agrees (the manifest's maps[] entry and continentGeography region, the client's generated
publication) and unless it and its eight neighbours are walkable on the destination's vendored grid, steppable from
it, and none is a walk-over trigger.

Checks, all fail closed (nothing is relocated; a row is moved in its source, never here):
- every row's tile and its eight neighbours are open on the served grid after storage erosion (the server's
  eloria.collision.with_storage_collision) and reached from some map's arrival over the land crossings (portal
  triggers are stepped onto and fire, never walked across) with every NPC post closed, as the server blocks the tile
  an NPC stands on (an NPC's own post need only be open ground; a harvest node's own tile is closed, as the node is a
  body, and only its ring is judged): spawns, harvest nodes, NPC posts (new and re-homed),
  interactives, the ferry trigger, the arrivals and home points, every landing target, approach and cast post, and
  every quest stage tile (a landing target on a node, like one on a post, is walked to an approach tile); every
  lane's departure and arrival are reached;
- a spawn's creature exists, is passive, and its footprint fits (eloria.collision.erode_for_footprint);
- every row lies inside its own map's ownership polygon;
- object ids are unique per map across nodes and interactives, positive and below the exits' 60000;
- NPC posts are unique and stand on no trigger, arrival, home point, spawn row or interactive;
- the overlay loads with the server's own loaders over a copy of the base tables (duplicates, foreign maps, inline
  '#', row shapes), and landing.json, homes.json and home_npcs.txt pass the server's parsers when the server tree
  has eloria/landing.py and eloria/home.py, and this tool's own copy of their rules always.
The 19 rows of the B14 pocket (server-tables.json holdBack) are served only if every one of them passes; otherwise
all 19 are held back and recorded, and any other failure refuses the publish.

--check builds everything and compares it with the server tree and the record, writing nothing there (the sync runs
into a temporary folder seeded with the server's vendored manifest); it exits 1 on any difference. --apply writes.
The server's loader counts and parser results, and the ferry landing's copies and grid, go to the run's summary
(stdout, --report), not to the record. The packages must come from one export_collision.py run (crossings_v2's
check_one_run).

====================

{generated}

The continent-v2 isles (Landfall, The Tollholms and The Gull Skerries) are served from this directory,
beside the profile's certified tables, which stay byte-identical. Each content loader reads the file of the same name
here and appends its rows after every base row (eloria/content_overlay.py holds the rules it enforces at startup);
`continent_v2_overlay = 0` in server.txt, or ELORIA_CONTENT_OVERLAY=0, serves the profile without it.

  maps.txt                    the three map rows, the land crossings both ways, the one-way exit ferry
  spawns.txt                  the isles' wild animals, each with its leash
  harvesting.txt              the resources the isles add, and every harvest node
  npcs.txt                    the isles' new people
  interactives.txt            the Landing Register desk and the ferry
  exterior_connections.json   the land links between the isles
  questlines.txt              Landfall's side errands (published from M2, with the chapter's code)
  landing.json                Signed Ashore's places (eloria/landing.py)
  homes.json                  the home's points, read only while home_map moves the home (eloria/home.py)
  home_npcs.txt               the people the home migration moves, read only while home_map moves the home

Every position comes from the client's scene markers and content tables through the territory frame
(eloria-assets/maps/continent-v2/_continent_v2/frames.py); the client records what it published from in
eloria-assets/maps/continent-v2/_continent_v2/publication.json.
