"""_continent_v2/image_policy.py: the rules the v2 publisher applies to source images before the chunk exporter.

The synthetic cases build tiny glTF documents (PNG images in the binary chunk) and check that a resampled image is
swapped for its recorded derived bytes as a new buffer view, that a derived file missing from the pool or not
hashing to its record is refused, and that the wrap resample keeps a tiling image tiling. The exporter case runs
nymara-regions' scene_io.Exporter on a policy-applied document: the source image is never written or counted, the
derived one is, under its own sha. The package cases check the committed isle packages against image_policy.json:
no cell names a rule's source image any more, and the cells sample the derived grounds. The kept cases: a rule for
an image the policy keeps uncompressed (keepUncompressed) is refused, the hub paving (owner call 2026-10-03) has no
rule and keeps its 1254 px bytes, and no committed package names a retired copy or was published while a rule still
swapped a kept image (they fail until the territory is republished with the current policy).
