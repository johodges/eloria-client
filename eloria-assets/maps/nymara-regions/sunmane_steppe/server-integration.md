# Sunmane Steppe - server integration

Everything in this document is server-side work that this client change
does **not** perform. The client change is self-contained and does not
alter the network protocol or any gameplay behaviour; the region loads
and is traversable with the server exactly as it is today.

`eloria-server` was not reachable from the workspace this package was
built in, so none of the records below could be committed there. They are
generated from the committed manifests by
`maps/nymara-regions/sunmane_steppe/source/server_integration.py`, so the matching server pull
request is transcription rather than redesign.

## Hooks

The region's hook names come from
`maps/nymara-regions/region-connections.json` and are
unchanged:

| Hook | Name |
|---|---|
| npc | `npcs.nymara.sunmane_steppe` |
| spawn | `spawns.nymara.sunmane_steppe` |
| hazard | `hazards.nymara.sunmane_steppe` |
| harvest | `harvest.nymara.sunmane_steppe` |

## Map registration

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Server map id | `maps/nymara/sunmane_steppe.elm` |
| Metres per server tile | 1.0 |
| Arrival datum | `(58, 58)` |
| Addressable tiles | 0..191 on both axes |
| Addressable world band | X -58..133, Z -133..58 |
| Walk portal west | `(6, 58)` from Amethyst Barrens `(110, 58)` |
| Walk portal east | `(110, 58)` to Amberwood `(6, 58)` |
| Interior entrance | `(58, 100)` to Ssarathi Royal Archive `(58, 10)` |

The region is wider than the addressable band on purpose. Everything
outside it - the far spires, the summits, the open sea - is scenery a
player can see but never stand on, and it is marked
`"reachable": false` in the manifest. The server needs no record of it.

## The interior map

Sunmane's two cave systems share **one** interior map, the way
Crownwater's and Ssarathi's insides do: one package, one server map id,
one collision grid, and unwalkable blackspace between the systems. Which
system a player gets is decided by the mouth they entered, so there is
one portal pair per door rather than one per system:

| Section | Mouth on the steppe | Arrival inside | Exit back to |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sunmane Wind Caves | `(128, 175)` | `(43, 27)` | `(128, 175)` |
| Amethyst Crystal Hollow | `(182, 154)` | `(169, 28)` | `(182, 154)` |

Both doors go to `maps/nymara/sunmane_wind_caves.elm`, which is one metre
per tile like the surface map, uses `invertServerY`, and puts its datum
at the map corner rather than the centre of a square, so a section's
tiles are simply its metres. The package is 192 m across, so the map needs
32 server tiles where the wind caves alone needed 10.

`maps/nymara/sunmane_crystal_hollow.elm` is **retired** as a served map.
The other two cave mouths on the surface - the drovers' shelter and the
eastern adit - are modelled shelters with no interior and need no
registration.

## Safe spawn surfaces

The client grounds actors by raycasting the navigation surface, and every
sampled column in the region grounds successfully, so any walkable tile is
a safe spawn. The positions the manifests name explicitly:

| Spawn id | Server tile | Map | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| arrival-datum | `(58, 58)` | sunmane_steppe | ceremonial crossroads at the shared market |
| west-caravanserai | `(6, 58)` | sunmane_steppe | arrival from Amethyst Barrens |
| east-caravanserai | `(110, 58)` | sunmane_steppe | departure toward Amberwood |
| north-barrowfield | `(58, 100)` | sunmane_steppe | Ssarathi Royal Archive entrance approach |
| default | `(43, 27)` | sunmane_wind_caves | Arrival for the wind caves mouth, and the map default. |
| wind-caves-mouth | `(43, 27)` | sunmane_wind_caves | Arrival for Sunmane Wind Caves. |
| crystal-hollow-adit | `(169, 28)` | sunmane_wind_caves | Arrival for Amethyst Crystal Hollow. |

## Hostile creature spawns (10)

All models below already exist in the client's creature catalogue.

| Model | Area | Count | Radius | Server tile |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `dire_wolf` | north mesa breaks | 3 | 10.0 m | `(28, 126)` |
| `dire_wolf` | eastern breaks | 3 | 10.0 m | `(132, 92)` |
| `wild_boar` | south-west scrub | 4 | 11.0 m | `(10, 8)` |
| `red_fox` | open steppe | 4 | 14.0 m | `(88, 108)` |
| `elk` | northern pasture | 4 | 12.0 m | `(6, 108)` |
| `mountain_goat` | coastal cliffs | 3 | 9.0 m | `(6, 46)` |
| `mountain_goat` | Whitehorn foothills | 3 | 12.0 m | `(150, 178)` |
| `dire_wolf` | wind cave approach | 3 | 11.0 m | `(114, 166)` |
| `red_fox` | amethyst badland | 3 | 12.0 m | `(172, 136)` |
| `wild_boar` | dune margin scrub | 4 | 12.0 m | `(34, 150)` |

## Interaction points needing server behaviour

The manifest declares 70 interaction points. The ones that need a server
decision rather than a client-side prompt are the map transitions:

| Id | Label | Server tile | Destination map | Arrival tile |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cave-wind_caves` | Sunmane Wind Caves | `(128, 175)` | `maps/nymara/sunmane_wind_caves.elm` | `(30, 12)` |
| `cave-crystal_hollow` | Amethyst Crystal Hollow | `(182, 154)` | `maps/nymara/sunmane_crystal_hollow.elm` | `(30, 13)` |

The remainder - wells, water stations, shrines, markets, shelters,
hitching rails - are ordinary interaction points and behave like the
equivalents in other regions.

## Livestock actor types

Three creature assets ship with this change: `sunmane_steppe_horse`,
`sunmane_dun_mare` and `sunmane_grey_pony`. They are registered in
`godot-client/data/actors/models.json` by model id and are instanced as
**scenery** by the client's ambient population system, so they need
nothing from the server to appear.

They are deliberately registered with `serverActorType: null`. Actor-type
numbers are the server's to allocate, and the creature block in
`models.json` currently runs 204-235. If the server wants these as
networked, attackable or rideable actors it should allocate the next free
numbers and add the matching `actorTypes` entries; until then the client
will simply never receive one over the wire, which is harmless.

## What must not change

The map deliberately requires no protocol change:

- One metre per server tile, and the arrival datum at `(58, 58)`, both
  matching the entry already committed in
  `godot-client/data/maps/registry.json`.
- Server tile to world position uses the existing `CoordinateAdapter`
  unchanged; the region moved its world centre, not its datum.
- Walkability remains server-authoritative. The client's navigation
  surface covers the whole landform on purpose, so a grounding raycast
  can never miss; it does not decide where a player may go.
