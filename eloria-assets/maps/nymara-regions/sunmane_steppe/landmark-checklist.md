# Sunmane Steppe — landmark checklist

Tracked from the written region description (`eloria-assets/qa/regions/sunmane-steppe/README.md`,
`NYMARA_ASSET_MANIFEST.md`), the aerial overview (`references/01-aerial-overview.png`) and the
ten-panel detail board (`references/00-concept-detail-board.png`).

Authority order: written description > aerial composition > player-scale detail board > runtime conventions.

## Region frame

| Metres per tile | 1.0 | `godot-client/data/maps/registry.json` |
| World span | 280 m x 280 m, centred on godot `(36, -36)` | derived |
| Addressable band | godot X -58..133, Z -133..58 | server tiles are non-negative |
| North axis | `-Z` | `world-manifest-1.schema.json` |
| West crossing | server `(6, 58)` -> godot `(-52, 0)` | Four Gates link (causeway road) |

| North barrow | server `(58, 100)` -> godot `(0, -42)` | sealed passage; the Archive is entered from the Ssarathi Ruins |

## Expansion inventory (north and east)

Added after the original build, at the user's request: the desert, the cave
entrances and the mountain boundary. These have no count in the written region
description - they extend the region toward its neighbours - so the target is
the continent design rather than a QA number.

| # | Item | Count | Status |
|---|---|---:|---|
| D1 | Desert ground: dune trains, salt pans, wash-interlocked margin | 12.2% of the map | **done** |
| D2 | Amethyst badland ground, carrying the Barrens' violet muted | 6.7% | **done** |
| D3 | Mountain scree and bare stone closing the north and east | 12.7% | **done** |
| D4 | Named summits along the Whitehorn front | 11 | **done** |
| D5 | Wind-carved badland spires | 8 | **done** |
| D6 | Cave entrances | 4 | **done** |
| D7 | ...of which lead to explorable interiors | 2 | **done** |
| D8 | Desert water stations on the sand road | 2 | **done** |
| D9 | Waystones marking the sand and badland tracks | 8 | **done** |
| D10 | Additional outposts (desert, mountain, eastern pass) | 3 | **done** |
| D11 | Desert drovers' camps | 3 | **done** |
| D12 | New roads: desert road, salt-pan spur, badland track, dune crossing, mountain approach, east pass, spire walk | 7 | **done** |
| D13 | Amethyst crystal clusters | 12 placed + scatter | **done** |
| D14 | Desert cover: dead scrub, bleached bone, loose stone, scree fans | scatter | **done** |

### Cave interiors

| # | Item | Wind Caves | Crystal Hollow | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Chambers | 5 | 5 | **done** |
| C2 | Connecting passages | 4 | 4 | **done** |
| C3 | Timbered passage sets | 7 | 10 | **done** |
| C4 | Brazier light markers | 5 | 5 | **done** |
| C5 | Crystal light markers | - | 3 | **done** |
| C6 | Underground camp | 1 | 1 | **done** |
| C7 | Still-water pool | 1 | - | **done** |
| C8 | Exit portal back to the steppe | 1 | 1 | **done** |

Both interiors continue the region's material language - pale canvas is absent
underground, but the timber, iron, leather and bone are the kit the surface
uses, and the amethyst is the same crystal family as the badland.

### Known deviations from the concept art

Stated plainly rather than glossed:

1. **No human crowds.** The concept panels show people at the market, the gate
   and the camps. Inhabitants are networked actors owned by the server; they are
   specified in `server-integration.md` and are not placed by this package.
2. **Lower prop density than the painting.** The concept is a painted image with
   effectively unlimited detail. The map is denser than any sibling region here
   but still reads sparser than the reference at close range.
3. **Ambient animals do not wander.** They idle in place with offset animation
   phases; locomotion belongs to the server-driven actor path.
4. **Grass is opaque blade geometry, not alpha cards.** This avoids alpha
   sorting and cutout artefacts at the cost of a thinner sward than the painted
   grassland implies.
5. **The palette runs slightly cooler and paler** than the concept's painted
   golden hour under the default daylight profile. The declared `golden-hour`
   environment variant is closer to the reference; daylight was chosen as the
   default because it keeps the playable scene readable rather than muddy, which
   the brief asks for explicitly. Panel 8 is compared against the golden-hour
   capture, since its reference is painted at dusk.
6. **Panel 10 is compared at stall scale, not macro.** Its reference is an
   extreme close-up of tack, bone, buckles and woven cloth - a framing no
   gameplay camera reaches. The comparison uses the nearest view a player can
   actually stand in, which shows the same material language on the market
   counter, pottery, crates, pennants and awning.
