"""The Sunmane Steppe's secrets: what the grass keeps.

The steppe is not a toolkit region: its entrances are placed by
`settlement.py` from `SECRETS` with the steppe's own kit assets, so `at`
here is a world position inside the server's addressable band
(x -58..133, z -133..58) rather than a landmark id.
