# Westhaven: coverage map

What the concept art contains, and where it is in the map. Coordinates are the
aerial's 8 x 8 reading grid (`region.cell(u, v)`), with Godot metres alongside.
`u` runs west to east, `v` north to south.

The mapping is 1:1 — the painting's four edges are the playable square's four
edges — so any feature can be located in the painting by its grid cell.

## The ten panels

Every panel has a subject in the map and a camera framing it. The framings are
in `source/views.py` and are shared by the offline previews and the real client
captures, so the two line up.

| # | panel subject | capture | built as |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | arched harbour gate over the water | `01-harbour-gate` | `havenarch.gate_arch`: single tall arch on cutwatered piers, flanking towers |
| 2 | lighthouse on a wave-battered rock | `02-lighthouse` | `havenarch.lighthouse`: battered tower, corbelled gallery, glazed lantern, lead dome |
| 3 | cobbled street climbing through an arch | `03-quay-street` | `market_climb` ramp street, granite setts, warehouse frontage |
| 4 | ship alongside with a gantry | `04-cargo-pier` | `havenarch.pier` + `gantry` + `ship_hull` |
| 5 | timber cargo crane with a laden net | `05-harbour-crane` | `havenarch.harbour_crane`: A-frames, treadwheel, raked jib, net |
| 6 | hull under construction on the stocks | `06-shipyard` | `havenarch.ship_on_stocks`: keel, stem, sternpost, 15 open frames, garboard strakes, shores |
| 7 | fish stalls under awnings in an arcade | `07-fish-market` | `arcade_range` + 9 `fish_stall` with striped awnings and catch |
| 8 | sea wall bastion with a banner | `08-mole-bastion` | `havenarch.bastion`: battered drum, merlons, banner mast, stair from the mole deck |
| 9 | rooftop terrace over a brass dome | `09-crown-terrace` | `havenarch.domed_hall`: colonnaded drum, ribbed brass dome, balustraded terrace |
| 10 | dockside still-life of crate, rope, chain, fish | `10-chandlery-macro` | a composed prop cluster at the chandlery, with the random quay scatter excluded within 7 m |

## Coverage gaps

Things visible in the concept that are **not** in the map, and why:

- **Figures.** No NPCs, dock workers or crowds are modelled. The board's panels
  are full of people; the static mesh carries none, because actors are the
  server's and the client's actor system, not the map's. Twenty NPC markers
  record where they belong.
- **Rigging detail.** Ships carry masts, one yard, one sail and three shrouds
  each. The painting's ships have full standing and running rigging. At the
  distance any camera sees them from this is a triangle budget decision.
- **Chain and rope as physical objects.** Panel 10 shows heavy chain and coiled
  rope. The map has the toolkit's `fishing_gear` and mooring rings; a dedicated
  chain-link and coiled-rope prop was not written.
- **Interior spaces.** Nothing is enterable. The five finished regions each got
  an interiors pass on a separate branch; Westhaven has not had one.
- **Smoke, gulls, spray, banners in wind.** Declared in
  `environment.presentation` as zones and flags for whoever writes those
  systems; no particle geometry ships.
