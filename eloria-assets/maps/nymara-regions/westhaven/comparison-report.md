# Westhaven: comparison report

The build against the concept art, panel by panel. An honest reading, not a
score sheet.

The sheets are in `references/comparisons/`:

- `aerial-comparison.webp` — the concept aerial above the build's aerial
- `panel-comparison.webp` — all ten detail-board panels against their captures
- `landmark-contact-sheet.webp` — every capture in the set

**The build frames in these sheets are real Godot 4.7.2 client frames**, drawn
through the project's own `WorldLoader` with the Vulkan driver on Forward+.
They are not offline previews. The sheet says so on its own caption line, and
the provenance is recorded per frame in `references/godot-captures/index.json`.

The offline previews from the toolkit's C rasteriser are also shipped, in
`references/captures/`, using the same camera table. They are an authoring aid.
Where the two differ — the offline set is warmer and lower-contrast — that is a
difference between two renderers.

## The aerial

**What matches.** The composition transfers. A dense terracotta-roofed city on
a south-facing headland; a continuous quay across its foot; a curved mole
closing a harbour; finger piers and moored ships; two rocky masses out in the
water to the south, each with a light; open green upland with tree belts and
switchbacked roads to the north-east; a sandy bay biting into the east coast.
Everything in the painting is in the map and in the right place, because the
reading grid maps 1:1.

**What does not match.**

1. **Projection.** The concept is a three-quarter oblique from the south-west;
   the build's aerial is near-vertical. They cannot be overlaid. A matching
   oblique would compare better but would hide half the map behind the city,
   and this shot's job is coverage.
2. **Vertical drama.** The painting's skyline is still spikier: its towers are
   proportionally taller and thinner than anything here. Seven lesser towers
   were added on the terrace bands, which closes much of the gap seen from the
   water; from directly above it still reads flatter than the painting.
3. **Density of shipping.** The painting has roughly twenty vessels and a dozen
   small jetties. The build now has sixteen hulls, two working piers and eight
   jetties, where the first pass had nine hulls and two piers.
4. **Colour temperature.** Closer than it was. The `environment` block is now
   art-directed against the painting — warmer and lower sun, saturation 1.34,
   less fog — and the coast carries white water, which is a large part of the
   painting's brightness. The client frame is still cooler than the painting's
   golden afternoon.
5. **Ground texture variety.** The painting's upland is a patchwork of ochre,
   olive and dry gold. The build's salt turf is one recipe with noise, so the
   upland reads more uniform. Unchanged in the second pass.

## The ten panels

| # | subject | verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | arched harbour gate | **Partial.** The arch, piers, cutwaters and flanking towers are there and the proportion is close. The panel's gate spans open water with ships passing under it; the build's stands at the mouth of the west inlet with its feet nearer the shore, so it reads as a gatehouse more than a water gate. |
| 2 | lighthouse on a wave-battered rock | **Good.** Battered tower, string courses, corbelled gallery with an iron rail, glazed lantern, lead dome, keeper's house, and the rock reads as rock. The region now has surf and there is foam at the rock's foot, but three framings were tried and none puts the tower and its breaking water in one frame the way the panel does. The sea is present rather than the subject. |
| 3 | cobbled street climbing through an arch | **Good.** The climb now runs *through* an arch with two jettied storeys carried over it, which was the panel's defining feature and the thing the build had no equivalent of. Granite setts, warehouse frontage, lamps. |
| 4 | ship alongside with a gantry | **Good.** Pier on piles with a planked deck, shear-legs gantry with a crate on the fall, a two-masted hull alongside. Rigging is much simpler than the panel's. |
| 5 | timber cargo crane | **Good.** The treadwheel crane is the closest single object in the region to its panel: A-frames, spoked wheel on its axle, raked jib, laden net. The wheels were below the quay until the transform bug was fixed. |
| 6 | hull under construction on the stocks | **Good.** Keel, raked stem and sternpost, fifteen open frames, three garboard strakes a side, shores and keel blocks. You can see through it, which is the point. |
| 7 | fish stalls under awnings in an arcade | **Good.** Arcade with arches and a tiled roof, nine stalls with striped awnings, catch on the trestles, baskets. |
| 8 | sea wall bastion with a banner | **Good.** The mole now runs out with surf breaking along its whole weather face, which is most of what the panel is, and the bastion stands at the bend with its merlons and banner. Framed along the mole rather than up at it from the water. |
| 9 | rooftop terrace over a brass dome | **Good.** Colonnaded drum, ribbed brass dome, lantern and finial, balustraded terrace, city and sea beyond. |
| 10 | dockside still-life | **Partial.** The cluster now has the two props it was missing — a rope flaked down in a coil, and chain with alternate links turned — beside crates, barrels, sacks and fishing gear, and the random quay scatter is excluded within 7 m of it. It is a composed arrangement rather than a junk pile. It still reads wider than the panel's macro. |

**Seven of ten are good, three partial, none weak.** The first pass was four good, five partial and one weak; the difference is surf, the street arch, the rope and chain, and the transform fix.

## What the second pass changed

Everything on the first pass's list was done.

1. **Surf.** 719 alpha-cut foam cards and seven breaker sheets, placed where the
   terrain crosses the water line and weighted by **exposure**: the outward
   direction of a shore cell is downhill, so a cell facing south or west takes
   the weather and gets heavy foam, and one facing into the harbour gets almost
   none. 1,522 triangles, and by a distance the largest improvement in this
   document. Two bugs on the way — a height band caught 797 cells out of 101,761
   on a coast this steep and had to become a blurred ring mask, and the exposure
   term was written with the gradient's own sign and so came out exactly
   negated, putting the heavy foam inside the harbour.
2. **Rope and chain**, and the panel-10 cluster composed around them.
3. **An arch over the quay street**, carrying two jettied storeys.
4. **`environment` art-directed** against the painting: warmer and lower sun,
   saturation 1.22 to 1.34, less fog.
5. **Seven more towers** on the terrace bands — a parish belfry and a merchant's
   lookout, not another cathedral.
6. **Eight jetties and seven more hulls.**

Adding surf also let a texture bug be removed rather than papered over.
`westhaven_sea_rock` baked the three tide zones in as horizontal bands of the V
coordinate, which is right for a vertical sea wall and wrong for the terrain the
same material covers: at terrain UV scale the bands tiled into hard stripes
every three and a half metres, and the lighthouse rocks read as corrugated iron.
The recipe is now isotropic — jointing, fracture, lichen and weed as blotches —
and the tide is told by the surf geometry, which is correct at every
orientation.

## What would most improve it next

1. **A framing for panel 2 that holds the tower and its breaking water
   together.** Three were tried and none does; it may want a camera out on the
   water with a longer lens than the harness's fixed field allows.
2. **The harbour gate standing in open water**, with the inlet cut back so ships
   pass under it.
3. **Rigging.** Ships carry one yard, one sail and three shrouds each.
4. **A tighter macro rig for panel 10** — the harness's minimum framing distance
   is what keeps it reading wide.
5. **Ground-texture variety on the upland.**

## What this report does not say

It does not say the map is finished art. It says which subjects are present,
which are recognisable and which are not, judged by looking at the captures
beside the concept. Composition, proportion and colour are reported as I read
them; someone who owns the art direction should disagree with some of it.
