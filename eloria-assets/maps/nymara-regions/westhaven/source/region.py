"""The authored Westhaven region plan.

Coordinates are Godot metres, Y up, north toward -Z. The playable footprint is
the server's 576-cell grid at one metre per tile with the arrival datum at
server (174, 250), which lands on the Godot origin:

    godot_x = server_x - 174        godot_z = 250 - server_y

so the reachable area is x in [-174, 401] and z in [-325, 250]. The terrain is
cut larger than that on every side, and the surplus is drowned or walled so a
player can never walk off the authored world. Why the datum is not the
(174, 174) the other five regions share is argued at SERVER_ORIGIN below.

READING THE CONCEPT
-------------------
The aerial is a working port, not a coastal village: a dense masonry city on a
south-facing headland that steps down through five terraces to a continuous
built waterfront, a curved mole closing a harbour basin, finger piers and a
shipyard along that waterfront, open upland with roads to the north and east,
and two rocky lighthouse masses out in the water to the south.

Two structural decisions follow from that reading, and everything else hangs
off them.

**The city is a staircase, not a hill with houses on it.** In the painting the
roofs march downhill in distinct level bands with retaining walls between them,
which is what a real port on a slope looks like and what makes the silhouette
read from the water. So the terrain is authored as explicit terraces with
graded ramp streets between them, not as smooth ground that buildings are later
dropped onto. Sculpting it as a slope and placing houses on it produced a
hillside of scattered roofs with no skyline at all.

**The sea floor is terrain, not a hole.** The client grounds actors by casting
a ray down at every server tile, not only walkable ones, so a region whose
southern half is open water still needs a continuous surface underneath it.
Westhaven's heightfield covers the entire footprint and simply sits below sea
level across the south. That is what makes zero grounding misses achievable on
a map that is 40% water.

MAPPING THE PAINTING ONTO THE FOOTPRINT
---------------------------------------
The aerial is read on an 8x8 cell grid, cell (0,0) at its north-west corner.
`cell()` converts a grid coordinate to design space. The mapping is 1:1 on both
axes: the painting's west, east, north and south edges are the playable square's
four edges. Nothing is invented beyond the concept and nothing is trimmed out of
it. That is what the arrival datum was moved to buy.

# The arrival datum is at server (174, 250), not the (174, 174) the five
# finished regions share. That is a deliberate departure and the reason is the
# concept: Westhaven is 40% water, and (174, 174) puts only 30% of the map south
# of the spawn. A harbour city whose spawn is on the quay cannot then have more
# sea than that, so the harbour, both lighthouse rocks and the open water all
# get squeezed into a third of the frame while the upland gets more room than
# the painting gives it.
#
# Moving the datum 76 cells south makes the painting map 1:1 onto the playable
# square on *both* axes - its west and east edges are the playable west and east
# edges, its top edge is z = -325 and its bottom edge is z = +250 - so nothing
# has to be invented past the concept and nothing has to be trimmed out of it.
