"""Westhaven's camera set and detail-board panel mapping.

Per-region data used by the shared toolkit's `capture_views.py` and
`make_comparison.py`, and - via `camera-views.json`, which the build emits from
this same table - by the in-engine capture harness
`_toolkit/godot_capture.gd`.

One table, two consumers, so an offline preview and a real client frame are
always the same framing and can be compared honestly.

Coordinates are design-space (x, z) pairs, the same 192 m space `region.py` is
written in, so they scale with the region. Heights are metres **above the local
ground**, not absolute Y - a camera given an absolute height ends up underground
the moment the terrain changes.

Design space maps to the painting's 8x8 reading grid through `region.cell()`:
design = (u * 24 - 58, v * 24 - 108.24). Every panel framing below is annotated
with the grid cell it is standing in, so a later pass can check a shot against
the painting rather than against somebody's memory of it.
