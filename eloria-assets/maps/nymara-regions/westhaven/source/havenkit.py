"""Westhaven's material recipes and the region's material pin.

WHY THIS IS NOT IN `_toolkit/`
------------------------------
The production guide says a region needing new material recipes should add them
to the shared toolkit rather than fork it. It is right, and this module is
written so that promoting it is a move and not a rewrite: every recipe is a
plain `TextureSet` factory with the same signature as everything in
`textures.py`, and every spec is a plain `MaterialSpec`.

It lives here for the same reason Crownwater's `crownkit.py` does, and the
reason has not gone away: `materials.SPECS` is a module-level tuple that four
unfinished regions are all queued to append to, and three independent appends to
one tuple is the silent-corruption case that file's own comment warns about.
Westhaven adds its materials by *extending the table at build time* -
`register()` appends to `materials.SPECS` in memory before either registrar
reads it - so nothing under `_toolkit/` is modified and there is no merge
conflict to resolve. Promotion later is a copy-paste of `SPECS_EXTRA` into
`materials.SPECS` and of the factories into `textures.py`.

Every name here is `westhaven_`-prefixed, so it cannot collide with any other
region's additions even after promotion.

WHAT THE CONCEPT NEEDS THAT THE SHARED TABLE HAS NOT GOT
--------------------------------------------------------
Amberwood is a forest region and Crownwater a marble city on still water.
Westhaven is a *working port*: its surfaces are wet, salted and worn by traffic,
and the shared table has no wet stone, no tide line and no sea-bleached timber.
The six recipes below are the ones without which the painting cannot be
reproduced at all.

- `westhaven_sett` - the granite setts of the quays and ramp streets. The
  shared `cobble_paving` is a mossy woodland courtyard: rounded, organic,
  leaf-littered. A port's quay is square-cut kerbstone laid in courses, worn
  smooth in the cart tracks and dark with water in the joints.
- `westhaven_quay_plank` - the timber decking of the piers and the slipway,
  tarred and salt-bleached. `timber_grey` is a dry building plank.
- `westhaven_tide_shingle` - shingle at the water line, wet and weed-streaked.
  `shore_shingle` is a dry beach and reads bone-pale against this water.
- `westhaven_salt_turf` - the coarse coastal grass of the headland and upland.
  `meadow_grass` is inland pasture and is far too lush and too green.
- `westhaven_sea_rock` - the cliffs, the mole's outer face and the two
  lighthouse rocks. Closest to the shared `cliff_rock`, but that recipe is a
  warm inland sandstone; this is cold grey storm-washed stone with barnacle and
  weed banding at the tide line, which is the whole subject of panel 8.
- `westhaven_harbour_water` - a retint of the shared water surface. The
  painting's harbour is a deep green-blue, not Amberwood's grey sea nor
  Crownwater's turquoise lagoon. A colour decision, not a new surface, so it
  reuses the shared texture rather than paying for a second 512px water set.
