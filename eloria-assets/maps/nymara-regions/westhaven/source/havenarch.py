"""Westhaven's architectural kit: the pieces a working port is made of.

Same reasoning as `havenkit.py` for why this is here and not in `_toolkit/`:
every piece is a plain `MeshGroup` factory with the same shape as everything in
`stonework.py` and `architecture.py`, so promoting it is a move rather than a
rewrite, but four unfinished regions are queued to append to those modules and
this avoids the conflict.

The shared kit already covers a great deal - `stonework.column`, `balustrade`,
`retaining_wall`, `ancient_arch`, `high_bridge`, `lamp_post`, `rotunda`,
`architecture.roof`, `framed_wall`, `window`, `watchtower`, `manor`, and the
whole of `props` - and this module uses all of it. What it adds is the things a
harbour has that a forest and a lagoon city do not: a quay wall, a breakwater
mole, a timber pier on piles, a cargo crane, a ship, a ship on the stocks, and
a lighthouse.

WALK SURFACES
-------------
Every piece that a character can stand on registers that geometry through
`MeshGroup.add_walk`, and nothing else. The client turns node names matching
`navigation.surfaceNodePrefixes` into the layer its grounding ray tests, so a
whole landmark marked walkable snaps actors onto its roof. Quay aprons, pier
decks, the mole deck and the bastion platform are walk surfaces; walls, roofs,
hulls, jibs and rigging are not.
