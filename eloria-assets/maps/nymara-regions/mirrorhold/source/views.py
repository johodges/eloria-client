"""Mirrorhold's camera set and detail-board panel mapping.

Per-region data used by the shared toolkit's `capture_views.py` and
`make_comparison.py`. Coordinates are design-space (x, z) pairs; heights are
metres above the local ground, not absolute Y, so a camera cannot end up
underground when the terrain changes.

Each view is (id, panel, (eye_x, eye_z), eye_height_above_ground,
              (target_x, target_z), target_height_above_ground,
              fov_degrees, (width, height), shadow_radius, lighting_mode).
`panel` is the detail-board panel the shot answers, or None for coverage
views, or "aerial" for the overview.
