"""The authored Mirrorhold region plan.

Coordinates are Godot metres, Y up, north toward -Z. The playable footprint is
the server's 576-cell grid at one metre per tile with the arrival datum at
server (174, 174), which lands on the Godot origin:

    godot_x = server_x - 174        godot_z = 174 - server_y

so the reachable area is x in [-174, 401] and z in [-401, 174]. The terrain is
cut larger than that on every side and walled, so a player can never walk off
the authored world.

Composition follows the aerial concept, which is a mountain read north to
south:

  * glacier and bare peaks close the north;
  * the observatory citadel sits on the summit massif, crowned by the great
    mirror-sphere in its armillary mount, its terraces holding still reflecting
    basins - the pools are what the region is named for, not the lake;
  * a civic descent of terraces, switchback roads, canals and waterfalls steps
    down the south face, with the stepped cliff town on the west shoulder and
    an aqueduct on the east;
  * the mirror lake fills the southern basin, with the ring - a colonnaded
    island - at its centre on radial causeways, and a harbour on its north
    shore.

Everything is written in a 192 m design space and scaled by SCALE, so the
concept's composition is preserved rather than stretched.
