"""The authored Verdant Stair region plan.

Coordinates are Godot metres, Y up, north toward -Z. The playable footprint is
the server's 576-cell grid at one metre per tile with the arrival datum at
server (174, 174), which lands on the Godot origin:

    godot_x = server_x - 174        godot_z = 174 - server_y

so the reachable area is x in [-174, 401] and z in [-401, 174]. The terrain is
cut larger than that on every side, and the surplus is drowned to the south-west
or raised into cliff walls, so a player can never walk off the authored world.

Composition follows the aerial concept, which is a diagonal: a turquoise lagoon
in the low south-west corner, and from it a flight of great terraces climbing
north-east, each one a level shelf of cut limestone edged by a cliff riser with
waterfalls pouring off it into the pools of the terrace below, up to the temple
on the highest shelf. That diagonal is the region - the name is literal - so
the terrain is authored as a function of position along it rather than as noise
with places dropped on top.

## The two coordinates that matter

Everything is placed in **stair coordinates**, not in x/z:

    s = (x - z) / 2   how far up the stair, south-west to north-east
    c = (x + z) / 2   how far along a terrace, north-west to south-east

both in the 192 m design space, which `SCALE` maps onto the real extent. `s`
alone decides which terrace a place stands on, so a place can never end up
accidentally halfway down a cliff, and spreading places along one terrace is a
matter of varying `c`. Read `TERRACES` and `_STAIR_ANCHORS` first; everything
else hangs off them.

# Riser gaps are deliberately narrow. A 2.5-unit gap is 10.6 m of ground for a
# rise of 17 to 28 m, which is a cliff; the 6-unit gaps of the first draft were
# 25 m of ground for the same rise, which is a 40-degree ramp a player simply
# walks up, and the region stopped reading as a stair at all. The one wide gap
# is seabed to strand, which is a beach and should be a ramp.

# Heights are world metres and are NOT scaled with the region. A 24 m cliff is
# a 24 m cliff whether the map is 192 m or 576 m across; doubling relief along
# with area would double every climb a player makes and change no picture.
