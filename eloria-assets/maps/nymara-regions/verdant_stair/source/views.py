"""Verdant Stair's camera set and detail-board panel mapping.

Per-region data used by the shared toolkit's `capture_views.py` and
`make_comparison.py`. Coordinates are design-space (x, z) pairs; heights are
metres above the local ground, not absolute Y, so a camera stays where a
player's eye would be when the terrain is re-sculpted.

Each view is

    (id, panel, (eye_x, eye_z), eye_height, (target_x, target_z),
     target_height, fov, (width, height), shadow_radius, lighting)

Design space is the 192 m frame `region.SCALE` maps onto the real extent, and
the region is written in stair coordinates, so the comment after each camera
gives the (s, c) it sits at - `s` is which terrace, `c` is where along it.
