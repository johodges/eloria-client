# Verdant Stair landmark checklist

Region extent: 576 m × 576 m (server tiles 0–575 at one metre per tile, arrival
datum at server (174, 174)). Coordinates below are Godot metres, north toward
−Z. "Terrace" names the shelf a place stands on; see `modeling-assumptions.md`
for the stair coordinates the whole region is laid out in.

Status key: **built** — modelled, placed, grounded and verified in the package;
**partial** — present but below the standard the concept describes.

## The stair

| Terrace | Height | What is on it |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| seabed | −13 m | the lagoon, its inlet and sea stacks |
| strand | 0.4 m | beach, boat landing, mangrove bight, the Westhaven quay |
| quay | 7 m | west quay, quay market, plunge pool below the first fall |
| lower | 24 m | the arrival town: waygate, plaza, Tessara, Orru Moss, gardens, foot of the Grand Stair |
| middle | 46 m | the cenote, the canopy village, the market, the root and rope crossings |
| upper | 72 m | the water shrine, the aqueduct, the hanging gardens, the reclaimed terrace |
| temple | 100 m | the Green Temple, its court, the processional stair, the sun pavilion |
| summit | 124 m | ridge shrine, cloud terrace, the quarry, the Ssarathi pass |

Captures live in `references/godot-captures/` (real client frames, rendered
through the project's own `WorldLoader` by `_toolkit/godot_capture.gd`) and in
`references/captures/` (offline previews from the authoring renderer). Every
sheet in `references/comparisons/` names which set it was built from.
