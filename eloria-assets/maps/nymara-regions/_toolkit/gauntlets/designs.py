"""The eight gauntlets: route, theme, rosters, bosses and rewards.

Everything a run needs is declared here once. The map builder reads the
route and the theme; the server tool reads the rosters, bosses, caches and
keepers and writes the instance, spawn-group and drop files from them, so a
change to a wave is a change to one line here followed by one tool run.

Kinds of leg (see rooms.py for the geometry):
    hall      a pillared room, the plain fight
    cavern    a wide rough chamber with the region's rock and growth in it
    bridge    a narrow span: the party fights on a front two abreast
    stair     a climb; the fight is at the top landing, on the high ground
    gallery   a long room with alcoves, one of which holds a bonus
    fork      a hub with two gates; the party picks a way, and the way
              not taken seals behind the choice
    court     the boss room, always last

A leg's `advance` is what opens the gate after it: `cleared` (everything in
the room is dead), `time:N` (N seconds after the wave lands, dead or not, so
the route keeps moving), `open` (never barred - a breather). Its `trigger` is
what lands the wave: `enter` (the first participant to step into the room)
or `at_gate` (the moment the gate before it opens, so the room is already
full when the party comes through).

A band is one difficulty of the same route: an a/d bracket, a roster to
draw waves from, a boss. Waves are generated per leg from the roster by the
server tool (three variants each, one picked at random per run), so the same
road is never quite the same run twice; `pressure` on a leg scales how many.
