"""The Four Gates' secrets: what the city keeps under its flags.

Four Gates is not rebuilt by this pass, so its entrances are declared by
hand in `four-gates/world.json` (`tools/four_gates_secret_doors.py` writes
them from this table); `at` is a city position, and no prop is placed - the
city's own street furniture at each spot is the thing a player uses.
