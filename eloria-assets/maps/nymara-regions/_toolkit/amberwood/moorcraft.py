"""Grey Moors kit: barrows, standing stones, boardwalks, crofts and peat works.

Everything here is modelled from the ten-panel concept detail board. The region
is a drowned burial moor, so the kit is deliberately narrow: granite that has
stood a long time, drystone that is falling down, timber that is permanently
wet, and two kinds of light - votive amber in the barrow mouths and the cold
blue of marsh lights out on the bog.

Two conventions matter for the runtime contract:

* A barrow mound is *terrain*, not a mesh. `region.build_terrain` raises the
  mound as a dome and paints it `terrain.BARROW_TURF`; this module supplies
  only the portal stonework and the kerb standing in it. Modelling the mound as
  geometry would put a dome over ground the grounding ray still hits, and a
  character would walk through the hill.
* Anything a character may stand on goes through `MeshGroup.add_walk`, so it
  exports under the navigation prefix. On this region that is exactly the
  boardwalk decks and the causeway bridge decks - nothing else.
