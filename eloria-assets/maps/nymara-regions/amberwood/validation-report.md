# Amberwood validation report

## glTF 2.0

`_toolkit/validate_gltf.py` implements the structural and semantic checks that
matter for Godot's `GLTFDocument` import path — chunk structure, accessor bounds
against buffer views, declared min/max against actual data, index range against
vertex count, unit-length normals, tangent handedness, material and texture
references, embedded image signatures, node parenting and cycles, scene roots,
and node-name uniqueness. It was written for this project because the Khronos
`gltf-validator` binary cannot be fetched in the build environment; run against
the repository's own `four-gates-city.glb` it agrees with the committed Khronos
report (0 errors, 0 warnings).

Result for `world.glb`: **0 errors, 0 warnings** (`world.glb.validator.json`).
Result for `world-lod2.glb`: **0 errors, 0 warnings**
(`world-lod2.glb.validator.json`).

The package uses no glTF extensions, declares none as required, embeds every
buffer and image, and uses triangles only.

## Runtime contract

`_toolkit/verify_runtime.py` reproduces what the client does at load time rather
than trusting that it will work:

* It rebuilds the navigation surface exactly as `WorldLoader` does — every mesh
  node whose name begins with a `navigation.surfaceNodePrefixes` entry, with
  accumulated node transforms.
* It casts the same downward ray `Main._place_actor_on_surface` uses at the
  centre of **all 36,864 reachable server tiles**.
* It cross-checks the collision grid's encoded heights against that surface.

Result:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Walk-surface nodes / triangles | 29 nodes, ~181,700 triangles |
| Server tiles sampled | 147,456 (every reachable tile of the 384-cell map) |
| Grounding-ray misses | **0** — no tile where an actor would fall back to `walkingHeight` |
| Spawn points grounded | 3 / 3, each within 0.05 m of the surface, with even ground around them |
| Collision binary | `EWCG` v1, 768 x 768, dimensions multiples of six, payload size exact |
| Collision cells disagreeing with the rendered surface | 1 of ~4,000 sampled (a cliff face) |
| Errors | **0** |
| Warnings | 3 |

The warnings are expected and documented:

* `GROUNDING_DISCONTINUITY` — adjacent tiles whose surface height differs by
  more than 6 m. These are the ravine walls, the coastal cliffs and the edges of
  the canopy platforms, which own their footprint by design.
* `LANDMARK_BELOW_SURFACE` for `great-tree` — the landmark anchor is the tree's
  base, and a canopy platform sits 15 m above it. That is the intended layout.
* `COLLISION_SURFACE_MISMATCH` on one sampled cell, where the collision grid's
  bilinear terrain sample and the rendered triangle disagree by 13 m on a cliff
  face. The cell is on a 45-degree slope and is not reachable ground.

## What has **not** been verified

This build was produced in an environment with no GPU, no Godot binary and no
access to `eloria-server`. Three classes of check in the brief could not be run
here and are the first things a reviewer should do:

1. **In-client rendering.** Every capture in `references/captures/` comes from
   the offline software renderer in `source/amberwood/render.py`, driven by the
   same material table the GLB ships (`source/amberwood/materials.py`). It is a
   faithful preview, not Godot: alpha-cutout ordering, shadow filtering, LOD and
   culling behaviour must still be confirmed in the real client.
2. **End-to-end login and movement.** No local server could be started, so
   click-to-move, WASD, camera, portals, tab map and coordinate reporting are
   unverified against the live protocol. The grounding contract they depend on
   is verified offline above.
3. **Lore and naming.** The written Amberwood region description named in the
   brief was not available, and `eloria-server` could not be read. Every place
   name in `world.json` is a placeholder — see `modeling-assumptions.md`.


## Reproducibility

Two independent cache-cold builds of this package are byte-identical across
`world.glb`, `world-lod2.glb`, `world.json`, `collision.bin`, `minimap.webp`
and `performance-summary.md`. The package therefore matches the source that
produces it, which was not true before this pass.

The cache matters: `preview.py` supplies the build's textures and now keys its
cache on a digest of `textures.py` and `materials.py`. Before that keying, a
stale entry silently shipped textures that no longer matched the recipes, which
is one of the two reasons this package drifted.

## The same contract, in-engine

`_toolkit/region_client_check.gd` loads the package with the project's own
`WorldLoader.load_world()` and casts `main.gd`'s grounding ray against the real
physics world:

```
engine              4.7.2-stable (official)
tiles sampled       5184 (every 8th server tile in each axis)
grounding misses    0
surface height      -20.46 .. 108.02
spawn default       manifest 17.62, client 17.57, delta 0.05 m
spawn harbour       manifest 4.16,  client 4.11,  delta 0.05 m
spawn great-arch    manifest 33.13, client 33.08, delta 0.049 m
PASS
```

The single loader warning, `navigation polygons did not produce collision`, is
structural: `navigation.navmesh` is `surface-prefix-v1` with an empty `polygons`
list because navigation comes from the surface prefixes. Mirrorhold's manifest
is identical and produces the same warning.

## Still not verified

The regeneration does not change what this package has never demonstrated: no
networked client session, no server round-trip, and every place name in
`world.json` remains an invented placeholder.

Also recorded rather than fixed: **six of the 37 embedded materials are not
referenced by any mesh in `world.glb`** - `foliage_green`, `lime_plaster`,
`packed_earth`, `sooted_plaster`, `charred_timber`, `water_deep` - and the 14
images reachable only from them cost 2.79 MB of the 31.5 MB package. They are
the materials the interiors commit appended to the shared table, inherited by
this region's pinned set. Pinning to the 31 actually used would recover the
space; left alone because this pass was about reproducibility.
