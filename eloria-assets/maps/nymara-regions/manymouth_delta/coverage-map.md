# Manymouth Delta coverage map

What is authored where, so a reviewer can find any of it and see what is thin.

Coordinates are Godot metres (`x`, `z`), north toward `-Z`. The playable
footprint is `x ∈ [-174, 401]`, `z ∈ [-401, 174]`; server tile `(sx, sy)` maps
as `x = sx - 174`, `z = 174 - sy`.

### Ring three

`east_hamlet` (351, −174) · `south_hamlet` (174, 99) · `west_hamlet` (−129, 39) ·
`north_fishing` (102, −351) · `boat_yard` (−18, 84) · `upper_paddy` (48, −330) ·
`far_bar` (297, 57) · `east_watch` (363, −36) · `south_shrine` (72, 123) ·
`deep_grove` (204, −138)

## Watercourses

Seven named distributaries, all in `world.json` under `water.channels` as
waypoint polylines.

| Channel | Type | Floor |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `great_mouth`, `north_mouth`, `temple_mouth`, `south_mouth` | navigable | −7.2 m |
| `market_reach`, `mangrove_cut`, `cave_run` | shallow braid | −5.1 m |

Plus an unnamed ridged-noise braid network cut 3.6 m into the flats between the
bars, which is what makes the aerial read as a delta rather than an archipelago.

## Population and metadata

All carry `"authority": "server"`; nothing is baked into the mesh.

| | Count | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Landmarks | 12 | Listed above |
| Interactives | 7 | Arch gate, labyrinth door, hall door, market scales, ferry post, temple altar, paddy sluice |
| NPC markers | 46 | Villagers, traders, ferrymen, acolytes, farmers, fishers, a shipwright |
| Creature markers | 26 | Delta crocodile, drowned sentinel, labyrinth crawler, shore raider, canopy serpent, silt wight |
| Harvestables | 51 | Lotus root, rice, mangrove bark, banyan resin, river fish, shell lime, salt pan, palm heart |
| Portals | 5 | Four edge landings plus the labyrinth mouth |
| Spawns | 3 | `default` (town bar), `arch-stair`, `temple-quay` |

**Only two of the five portals exist server-side.** The Ssarathi Ruins pair and
the Flooded Labyrinth pair are in `config/eloria/maps.txt` on the server branch.
The Verdant Stair, Westhaven and Crownwater landings are client-side alignment
metadata only: wiring them would mean editing three other regions' map entries,
which is outside this region's scope.

## Where the coverage is thin

Stated plainly, because a coverage map that only lists what exists is a sales
document.

* **The north-west quarter is nearly empty.** By design — it is the open sea the
  painting shows — but it means roughly an eighth of the playable footprint has
  one hamlet (`sea_landing`) and nothing else. A player who swims out there
  finds water.
* **The jungle head in the south-east corner is scenery, not a place.** It has
  ground, trees and a horizon, and no authored content at all.
* **Interiors: none.** Every building in this region is exterior-only. The
  Flooded Labyrinth is a separate map and still a placeholder.
* **No sailing craft.** The region has dugouts and awning boats. Panel 4's
  lateen-rigged boats do not exist as a kit piece.
* **No pink.** Two panels use blossom as their accent colour and the region has
  no blossom material; the study vignette's petals are green foliage cards.
* **Creature and NPC markers are evenly scattered around their anchors**, not
  placed to a designed encounter layout. They are positions for the server to
  use or ignore.
