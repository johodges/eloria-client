# Manymouth Delta change log

## Placeholder → production (this pass)

The package that existed before this pass was the region's
`terrain-landmark-material-pass` placeholder. Nothing of its geometry survives.

### The starting condition, verified rather than assumed

Every defect the production guide lists was checked for this region:

1. **Terrain was flat.** `production-index.json` recorded
   `terrainHeightRange: [0.0, 0.0]`; the GLB held one `Terrain_ELM_Authority`
   mesh at y = 0 across 65 nodes and 19 meshes in 491 KB. Confirmed.
2. **Landmarks belonged to other regions.** Of 64 landmark entries, the named
   ones included `Resonant Crystal Cluster`, `Four Gates Waystone`,
   `Westhaven Lantern Tower`, `Ssarathi Sunken Court`, `Ssarathi Sun Stela`,
   `Amethyst Geode Cave`, `Grey Moor Dead Tree`, `Whitehorn Cairn` and three
   `Verdant *`. None preserved.
3. **The committed detail board was truncated** to exactly 786,445 bytes; its
   IDAT stream fails to inflate and only the top row of five panels decodes. An
   intact board was supplied and is now committed in its place.
4. **`source-elm/manymouth_delta.elm` was a flat placeholder** — 32×32 tiles,
   every tile id 0, every height byte 11. Confirmed and replaced.
5. **`world.json` had no `bounds` key** and no production status.
6. **There is no `qa/regions/manymouth_delta/` brief at all**, so unlike the
   other regions there was no prose starting point. The paintings were the only
   authority, which is what the guide says should win anyway.

### Built

* 576 m × 576 m at one metre per tile, on a 96×96-tile server map, arrival datum
  at server (174, 174).
* A braided delta: ~270 lens-shaped silt bars on a jittered lattice filtered by
  a land-probability field, seven named distributaries cut through them, a
  ridged-noise braid network between, an open-sea shelf to the north-west and a
  jungle head to the south-east.
* A walkway network of 27 routes, 73 deck segments and 28 landing stairs, which
  is this region's road system.
* Twenty-three named places: the great arch and its drowned platform, the stelae
  court, the stilt town with its tiered hall, arched market and quay, the
  floating market, the banyan landing, the paddy terraces and watchtower, the
  stepped temple and its quay, the labyrinth mouth, the overlook, ten hamlets.
* Nine new material recipes and five new tree species (`deltakit.py`,
  `stiltkit.py`), including a pinnate palm-frond atlas.
* `collision.swimmable`, `water.depths`, `water.channels` and
  `environment.traversal` in the manifest, so an aquatic traversal mode needs no
  rebuild. See `traversal-modes.md`.

### Bugs found and fixed in this region's own code

* **Every scattered bar came out identical.** `noise.stable_hash` is CRC-32 and
  tops out near 2.1e9, so slicing five decimal digits out of one key gave the
  size field a range of 0–2. Fixed by deriving each variate from its own salted
  hash. Invisible until you look at the map.
* **Walkway decks inherited the temple's height.** Taking a deck's level from the
  higher of its two landings ran the stelae-court-to-temple route dead level at
  14.8 m for a hundred metres. Deck level is now capped 2.2 m above the *lower*
  landing.
* **Boardwalk handrails were walkable.** Setting `walk_surface=True` on a
  `MeshGroup` placement renames the node `Walk_…`, and `export_glb` then names
  every *solid* child `<node>__<material>` — inheriting the prefix. Rails, pile
  heads and bamboo posts all became navigation surfaces and spawns snapped to
  the top of a rail post two metres above the deck. No placement in this region
  sets the flag now; `add_walk` alone is the correct idiom for a `MeshGroup`.
* **Spawns were declared on decks the client's ray falls through.**
  `plank_floor` lays real planks with real gaps and a run ends exactly on its
  endpoint, so a bounding-rectangle test claims coverage the geometry does not
  have. Spawns are now sited by a deterministic spiral search for flat ground
  with no deck over it.
* **The great arch rendered as a solid glowing teal ring.** glTF's
  `emissiveFactor` has no mask without an `emissiveTexture`, so it floods the
  whole surface; on near-black ruin stone it erased the albedo entirely. Found
  only because a real client frame was available. The inlay is painted into base
  colour now.
* **Bar tops came back as sand.** `assign_surface_by_rule` paints SHORE within
  1.6 m of the water line, and these bars are 1–2.5 m high. The first client
  aerial was a white sand flat. Sand now keeps the last 0.9 m at the edge.

### Fixes made in the shared toolkit

Three, all region-agnostic bug fixes rather than new behaviour, plus one small
capability. Flagged here because they change what **every** region's previews
and comparison sheets look like.

1. **`preview.py: scene_from_build` added only `parts`, never `walk_parts`.**
   Every walkable deck a landmark carries — a causeway deck, a quay, a canopy
   platform floor — was missing from every offline preview in every region: the
   previews were of the structure without its floor. Worse, a `MeshGroup` with
   *only* walk parts has an empty `parts`, which is falsy, so the group itself
   was passed to `add_mesh`; `MeshGroup.triangle_count` reports its parts' total
   while the group's own index buffer is empty, so the packed geometry claimed
   triangles it had no indices for and the C rasteriser read past the end of the
   buffer. On this region — whose walkway landings are exactly that shape — it
   segfaulted the preview and the minimap render. Now uses `all_parts`.
2. **`capture_views.py` built its material table before the region could
   register its own recipes.** A region adds materials by appending to
   `materials.SPECS` in memory inside its own `main()`, which this script never
   calls, so every region-specific material resolved to index 0 — `bark_oak`.
   Manymouth's water, decking, silt, sand and paddy all came back as bark and
   the delta rendered as a dry sand flat with no water in it. A region now opts
   in by exposing `register_materials(sets)` from its build module.
3. **`capture_views.py` and the region build resolved cameras differently.**
   The build snaps a `deck` camera onto the walk surface under it; this script
   only knew ground-relative heights, and additionally nudged every eye below
   20 m up to 33 m sideways looking for standing room. Because
   `godot_capture.gd` reads *this* script's index, the real client frames
   inherited the wrong framing too: this region's macro camera was authored 2 m
   from its subject and photographed village rooftops 30 m away. The build's
   `camera-views.json` now wins where it exists — one resolution, three
   consumers. A trailing `!` on a view's mode additionally pins the eye.
4. **`godot_capture.gd` now writes an `index.json`** beside the frames it
   produces, stamped with the engine version. Without it `make_comparison.py`
   found real client frames but no index and silently fell back to the preview
   renderer, so the sheets said "offline preview" while a better set sat unused
   in the next directory.

Nothing else in `_toolkit/` was touched. `libraster.so` could not be rebuilt —
there is no C compiler on this machine — so two rasteriser defects found during
this work are documented rather than fixed: it has **no BLEND path at all** and
draws every transparent material opaque, and `(int)floorf` on an unbounded UV
can overflow into a negative texture index.

### Server side

`eloria-server`, branch `feature/manymouth-delta-96-server-map`:

* `tools/generate_nymara_maps.py` — `manymouth_delta: 96` in
  `MAP_TILES_WIDE_BY_NAME` and `(174, 174)` in `ARRIVAL_TILES`.
* `tests/test_nymara_collision_contract.py` — expected size and arrival.
* `config/eloria/maps.txt` — the Ssarathi pair moved off Manymouth's 32-scale
  coordinates (which are open water on the production map) to the east watch
  landing at (537, 210), taken from the built `world.json`; and the Flooded
  Labyrinth repointed from Amberwood to Manymouth, where the concept puts it.
* `tests/test_nymara_maps.py` — the matching interior connection.

Verified: the generator produces a 576×576 collision grid with a walkable
arrival at (174, 174); the five Nymara/content test modules pass (21 passed).
On the wider suite, 81 of 513 tests fail on this branch — the suite was run with
the change and again with it stashed and the two failure lists are byte-for-byte
identical, so none are introduced and none fixed. Pre-existing and unrelated.
