"""Manymouth Delta's camera set and detail-board panel mapping.

Per-region data used by the shared toolkit's `capture_views.py` and
`make_comparison.py`, and - via `camera-views.json`, which the build emits from
this same table - by the in-client capture harness `_toolkit/godot_capture.gd`.

One table, two consumers, so an offline preview and a real client frame are
always the same framing and can be compared honestly.

Coordinates are design-space (x, z) pairs, the same 192 m space `region.py` is
written in, so they scale with the region. Heights are metres **above the local
ground**, not absolute Y - a camera given an absolute height ends up underground
the moment the terrain changes. In this region "the local ground" is very often
the channel bed two or three metres under the water, so a camera meant to stand
on a walkway is given the `deck` lighting/height mode and a height measured from
the bed, exactly as Crownwater's causeway shots are.

    #    others. Panel 3 is a plan-ish three-quarter view, so the eye is high

    #    separate server map. What this package can show is its threshold, so
    #    the framing is the cut arch from the water in front of it, with the

    #     a wet deck. A macro, so a narrow field and a very short throw.
    # On the arch approach walkway, 4 m short of the ruin platform, which is
