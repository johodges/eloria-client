"""Placement passes for Manymouth Delta.

`region.py` says where the land and the water are. This says what stands on
them. The order below is the guide's "largest to smallest": water, then the
walkway network that is this region's road system, then the landmarks, then the
villages that hang off the network, then planting, then props.

THE ONE STRUCTURAL IDEA
-----------------------
Everything is hung off the **walkway network**. In a land region you place a
village on a hill and a road to it; here the walkway comes first and the village
is what is nailed to it, because that is how the concept's settlements are
actually built. So `walkway_network()` resolves every route, every deck level
and every landing *before* any building pass runs, and the building passes read
their deck heights out of it rather than deciding independently. Two passes
choosing their own deck level is how a hut ends up half a metre under the
walkway it opens onto.

# WHY NO PLACEMENT HERE SETS `walk_surface=True`
# ----------------------------------------------
# `RegionBuild.place()` renames a placement's node to `Walk_<node>` when
# `walk_surface` is set, and `export_glb` then names every *solid* child of that
# node `<node>__<material>` - which inherits the `Walk_` prefix. The client turns
# anything matching `navigation.surfaceNodePrefixes` into the layer its grounding
# ray tests, so the boardwalk handrails, the pile heads and the bamboo posts all
# became walk surfaces two metres above the deck, and every spawn on a walkway
# snapped to the top of a rail post.
#
# Every walkable piece in this region is a `MeshGroup` that already declares its
# deck through `add_walk`, which `export_glb` exports as `Walk_<node>__<material>`
# on its own. `build_collision` and `verify_runtime` both key off `walk_bounds`,
# not off the flag. So the flag is redundant here and actively harmful: the
# correct idiom for a MeshGroup is `add_walk` alone.
