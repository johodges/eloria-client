"""Manymouth Delta's building kit: everything that stands in water.

Companion to `deltakit.py`, which holds the materials. Split because they are
two different kinds of thing and because the material module is the one that has
to be imported before the texture registrars run.

WHY THIS IS NOT IN `_toolkit/` (yet)
------------------------------------
Same reason as `deltakit`: three other region sessions are appending to the
shared kit modules right now, and a fourth concurrent edit to `architecture.py`
and `props.py` is how that table gets silently corrupted. Every piece here is
written to the shared kit's own conventions - a `MeshGroup` with `add_walk` for
anything a character stands on, local space with the origin at the piece's
footprint centre, `Rng(seed)` for all variation - so promoting the module later
is a move rather than a rewrite.

WHAT THE SHARED KIT ALREADY DOES, AND IS USED FOR
-------------------------------------------------
`props.rowing_boat`, `barrel`, `crate`, `basket`, `sack`, `fishing_gear`,
`market_stall`, `fence`, `signpost`, `hanging_lantern`, `undergrowth_patch`,
`boulder`, `rock_cluster`; `architecture.beam`, `post`, `plank_floor`,
`framed_wall`, `door`, `window`, `shutter`, `bracket`, `railing`, `roof`,
`steps`; `stonework.MeshGroup`, `ruin_fragment`, `column`, `retaining_wall`;
`treecraft.suspension_walkway`, `spiral_stair`; `trees.build_tree`.

WHAT IT DOES NOT, AND THIS MODULE ADDS
--------------------------------------
Amberwood's buildings stand on the ground. Every building in this region stands
on piles over moving water, which is not a variation on a lodge - the pile
field, the joist raft, the tidal splash zone and the ladder down to a moored
canoe are the whole vocabulary, and none of it exists in the shared kit.

The tree profiles are the other gap: the shared species are oak, maple, birch,
holly and pine. A delta needs palm, mangrove and banyan, and mangrove in
particular is a tree whose *roots* are the silhouette.
