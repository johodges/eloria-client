"""The authored Grey Moors region plan.

Coordinates are Godot metres, Y up, north toward -Z. The playable footprint is
the server's 576-cell grid at one metre per tile with the arrival datum at
server (174, 174), which lands on the Godot origin:

    godot_x = server_x - 174        godot_z = 174 - server_y

so the reachable area is x in [-174, 401] and z in [-401, 174]. The terrain is
cut larger than that on every side, and the surplus is raised or drowned so a
player can never walk off the authored world.

Composition follows the aerial concept (`references/01-concept-aerial-overview.png`):

  * a low ridge across the north-centre carrying the Great Barrow, crowned with
    a stone court - the one thing in the painting that stands above the rest;
  * rings and avenues of standing stones scattered over the whole moor, densest
    around the barrow ridge and in the middle distance;
  * black bog pools and peat cuttings through the low ground, crossed by
    boardwalks and stone causeways;
  * broken towers on the skyline at the west, north-west, north-east and east,
    which is what gives the flat middle distance a horizon;
  * sea biting into the south-west corner only, behind a low rocky coast;
  * a web of tracks, lit at intervals by waymarkers - the small bright points
    scattered all over the aerial.

The ten-panel detail board (`references/00-concept-detail-board.png`) is the
player-scale authority and is what the kit in `_toolkit/amberwood/moorcraft.py`
is modelled from.

Nothing in this region is tall. That is deliberate and it is what the concept
shows: the drama is horizontal, and the only vertical accents are the menhirs,
the tower stumps and one dead tree.
