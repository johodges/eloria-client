"""Grey Moors' camera set and detail-board panel mapping.

Per-region data used by the shared toolkit's `capture_views.py` and
`make_comparison.py`. Coordinates are design-space (x, z) pairs; heights are
metres above the local ground, not absolute Y - a camera given an absolute Y
ends up underground the moment the terrain changes.

Each row is:
    (id, panel or None, eye_xz, eye_height, target_xz, target_height,
     fov, (width, height), shadow_radius, mode)

The ten panels are the subjects recorded in `concept-generation-manifest.json`
for this region, in order:

    1 raised causeway        6 abandoned cottage
    2 turf barrow            7 wisp tree
    3 standing stones        8 peat and orchids
    4 bog boardwalk          9 coastal panorama
    5 crypt threshold       10 peat slate heather materials

# pulled below 1 so the heather and the votive flames are the only colour in
# the frame.
