# Grey Moors — change log

From `terrain-landmark-material-pass` placeholder to production package.

## The starting condition

Every defect in section 3 of the production guide was verified for this region
rather than assumed, and every one of them was present.

| defect | what was actually there |
| --- | --- |
| flat terrain | `world.glb` POSITION accessor `min [−96, 0, −96] max [96, 0, 96]` — y = 0 everywhere, and the extent only 192 m |
| foreign landmarks | 58 landmarks, opening with Crownwater Fishing Boat, Crownwater Ferry, Whitehorn Carved Stairs, Crownwater Patrol Boat, Mirrorhold Canal Stairs, Ssarathi Curved Wall, Sunmane Dry Cave, Mirrorhold Lake House, Amberwood Estate |
| truncated detail board | the tracked `00-concept-detail-board.png` was the broken 786,445-byte copy; only the top row of five panels decoded |
| flat placeholder ELM | `source-elm/grey_moors.elm` was 39,880 bytes, 32 × 32 tiles |
| QA README | present at `eloria-assets/qa/regions/grey-moors/README.md` — note the hyphen, not the underscore the guide implies |

**None of the placeholder geometry or metadata is preserved.** The package was
rebuilt from the concept art.

## What changed

### The detail board — resolved without a re-supply

An intact 2,853,593-byte board (1983 × 793, decodes fully, all ten panels) was
sitting **untracked** beside the broken one as
`references/grey-moors_00-concept-detail-board.png`. It matches the board the
user supplied. It is now the tracked `00-concept-detail-board.png`, and the
aerial concept is landed alongside it as `01-concept-aerial-overview.png`, so
the package carries both authorities.

### Extent

192 m → **576 m at one metre per tile**, on a 96 × 96 ELM grid with the arrival
datum at server (174, 174). Composition is authored in the placeholder's 192 m
design space and scaled by `region.SCALE`, so the change of extent is one
constant rather than a rewrite.

### Terrain

Flat → a sculpted low moor: a barrow ridge across the north-centre, eight
terrain-raised barrow mounds, twelve bog basins, three drains, four cut peat
terraces, a south-west bay, and a narrow closing rim. Playable height range
−16.0 m to 26.9 m; the walkable band is authored inside the server's six-bit
height byte.

### Toolkit

Added to, not forked (see `modeling-assumptions.md`): five surface classes,
fourteen material recipes, their specs, a `grey_moor_track` material over an
existing texture, a general `_bleed_into_alpha` helper, and a new
`amberwood/moorcraft.py` kit of 21 pieces.

### Metadata

58 foreign landmarks → 61 region-correct ones. 7 spawn points, 2 map
transitions taken from the server's own `maps.txt`, 4 interior entrances, 15
population markers, 64 harvestables, a complete `environment` block, and a
minimap rendered from the final geometry.

## Defects found and fixed during the build

These are the ones that mattered. Each was found by a tool or by looking at a
render, not by reasoning.

**Boardwalk planks the grounding ray fell through.** `mesh.box` takes full
extents; the deck was built with `width * 0.5` and its planks spaced at 40% of
their pitch. So the deck was half as wide as its own posts and 60% open gaps,
and the client's downward ray passed between the planks to the bog below. A
character crossing would have dropped off the boardwalk. Caught by
`verify_runtime`'s `COLLISION_SURFACE_MISMATCH` on a single sampled cell, then
traced by asking which placement claimed that cell.

**Boardwalk decks claiming ground behind them.** The mesh was modelled from its
near end, but the collision pass claims a deck's footprint symmetrically about
the placement using the mesh's half-extents. Each span therefore marked its own
length of open bog walkable at deck height. The mesh is now built centred.

**Scrub shading solid black in the real client.** Only the Godot capture showed
it; the offline preview looked correct throughout. Three compounding causes,
fixed in order: card normals were perpendicular to a vertical card so an
overhead key barely lit them; the atlas was drawn on a black background so
mip and bilinear filtering averaged plant colour with void; and the material
was double-sided, which makes Godot invert the normal on the back face, so an
up-leaning normal became a down-leaning one. The cards now carry explicit back
faces and the material is single-sided.

**Sixteen landmark markers floating.** Tower, dead-tree and Hanged Oak markers
sat at each feature's visual centre. Flagged by `LANDMARK_FLOATING`; moved to
where a player stands.

**A tenth of the walkable surface above the server's height ceiling.** The
closing rim was wide and gentle enough to be walkable, which put 10.4% of
reachable ground over the 10.4 m the ELM height byte can express. Cutting the
rim narrow relative to its height pushed its flanks past the collision slope
limit; the figure is now 3.05%, and those cells are rim shoulders.

**`TER.PATH` would have put forest litter down a moor.** The generic path class
maps to Amberwood's `leaf_path`. Rather than embed amber leaf litter, the region
took a fifth surface class, `MOOR_TRACK`, over the toolkit's existing
`packed_earth` texture with a cooled, darkened material.

## Corrections made after looking at renders

The guide is right that a map you have not looked at from 1.7 m is not finished.
Each of these was a render telling me something a validator could not.

- **The region read as a bright foggy beach.** Sky, ambient and fog all came
  down hard; the moor and scrub palettes went darker and cooler.
- **Peat read as flat near-black polygons with salt-and-pepper edges.** The
  cause was roughness, not colour: a sheen driving roughness to 0.22 turns matte
  peat into a dark mirror under overcast. Raised, and the surface dither pulled
  back now the two neighbouring classes sit nearer in tone.
- **Scrub read as straw bales, then as strewn blossom.** The atlas was 47%
  opaque — a solid mat, not an airy fringe — and the four atlas quarters were
  drawn uniformly, so a quarter of every clump on the moor carried white bog
  cotton. Thinned to 21% coverage and weighted so cotton is rare.
- **The barrow turf read as mown lawn.** Toned back toward the moor.
- **The bay was an inlet, not a coast.** 2.6% of the playable area, and the
  "coastal panorama" capture looked down a drain channel. Widened to 5.8%.
- **The standing stones were too small to read.** Measured against the painting
  — 576 m across 512 px puts its visible stones near 5 m — the first pass at
  1.7–3.2 m read as gravel from the air and as knee-high posts beside panel 3.
- **The moor was too sparsely stoned.** The aerial is covered in menhirs
  standing singly and in twos, not only in rings. 360 scattered standing stones
  were added.
- **Nine of the ten panel cameras framed the middle distance with their subject
  as a speck.** They were hand-written in design space; they are now derived
  from where the landmarks actually ended up, each eye a few metres off its
  subject on the subject's open side.

## Five kit pieces rebuilt after the first look

The barrow revetment stepped into a staircase because block count and arc span
both varied per course; the causeway bridge was built at half width; the croft
walls were rows of separate posts because stone size was not tied to course
spacing; the peat bank was buried below y = 0 leaving only its winch visible;
and the wisp's opaque outer shell hid its own core.

## Shared files touched

`godot-client/data/maps/registry.json` and
`maps/nymara-regions/production-index.json` — the `grey_moors` entry only, in
both. Expect to resolve any conflict by keeping both sides.

## Server

Separate branch, `feature/grey-moors-96-server-map` on `eloria-server`. Four
tables plus `maps.txt` and `client_content_manifest.json`. The portal
coordinates in `maps.txt` are rescaled from the 192-cell grid to the 576-cell
one for both of Grey Moors' declared neighbours.
