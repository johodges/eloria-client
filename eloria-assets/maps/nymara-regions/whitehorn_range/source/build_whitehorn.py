# carries the pinned material's own textures and differs only in alpha

def _environment() -> dict:
    """The manifest's `environment` block, consumed by WorldEnvironmentBinder.

    THE SIGN OF `sun.direction` IS THE DIRECTION THE LIGHT TRAVELS, not the
    direction of the sun in the sky. `world_environment_binder.gd` aims the key
    light with `sun.look_at_from_position(Vector3.ZERO, facing, up)`, which
    points the node's -Z at `facing`, and a DirectionalLight3D emits along its
    local -Z. So a positive Y component lights the world from underneath.

    The offline preview renderer uses the opposite convention: its
    `Lighting.sun_direction` points *toward* the sun. The two must therefore be
    negations of each other, and copying one into the other - which is what
    Amberwood's manifest does, declaring [-0.46, 0.50, 0.73] - inverts the key
    light. It has never been caught because no offline preview can show it.

    Whitehorn's preview sun is (-0.38, 0.62, 0.68); this is its negation.
