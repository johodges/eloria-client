"""Whitehorn Range: composition, extents and terrain sculpting.

The region-specific half of the map. Everything else comes from the shared
toolkit in `../../_toolkit/`.

Composition authority is `eloria-assets/concepts/nymara-regions/
whitehorn_range_region_concept.png`: a high alpine bowl with a strong
south-to-north rise. The approach climbs from a low southern gate through
cairn-lined switchbacks, crosses a gorge on rope bridges, and ends at a glacier
temple standing on a shelf below the head of the ice. An ice cave opens in the
west, a worked mine in the east, and frozen cascades hang off the shoulders of
the central glacier.

Player-scale authority is the ten-panel concept detail board.

As in Amberwood, the whole composition is written in a fixed 192 m design space
and scaled by SCALE, so changing the region's extent is one constant rather
than a rewrite.
