# Whitehorn Range coverage map

What exists where, and which concept source each place answers to. Design-space
coordinates are the 192 m authoring space; world coordinates are those times
`region.SCALE` (3.0). North is `-Z`.

## Composition spine

The region is read from the aerial as a bowl opening south. The pilgrim road is
the spine and every detail-board panel sits on or beside it:

```
  south (low, inhabited)                        north (high, glaciated)
  Whitehorn Gate -> cairn switchbacks -> gorge + rope bridge -> frozen
  cascade -> temple stair -> Glacier Temple -> glacier head
```

## Population

| Kind | Count | Placement rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cairns | 177 | along every route at fixed spacing, alternating side; dense clusters at the cairn ridge, lower bend and west watch |
| Waystones | 17 | at shrines, the cascade foot, the temple forecourt and the ridge |
| Seracs | 77 | along the authored glacier route, not by surface lookup, so they follow the ice below the snow line |
| Conifers | 870 | below snow line + 16 m, slope < 0.85, on snow or turf, density-gated |
| Rock clusters | 759 | anywhere not built, paved or blocked |
| Landmarks (metadata) | 14 | — |
| NPC markers | 6 | server authority |
| Harvestables | 30 | ore, ice, herb, wood; server authority |
| Portals | 4 | temple interior + three edges pinned to server tiles |
| Spawns | 3 | arrival, temple forecourt, mine yard |

## Surface classes in use

`Terrain_Snow`, `Terrain_Ice`, `Terrain_Rock`, `Terrain_Trail`,
`Terrain_Paving`, `Terrain_Marble`, `Terrain_AlpineTurf`.

Snow is the base class; rock breaks through where slope exceeds an
altitude-dependent threshold; ice is authored along the glacier route; turf is
restricted to low, sheltered, shallow southern ground.

## Walk surfaces

Only four, all under the `Walk_` prefix: the two rope-bridge decks, the temple
stair, and the temple forecourt deck. Everything else built is structural.

## Coverage gaps

- No interior for the mine or the ice cave; both are facades.
- No settlement. The aerial shows scattered structures rather than a village,
  and none of the ten panels is a dwelling, so none was authored.
- The eastern third of the map is thinner than the west: the mine, its yard and
  the east camp carry it, where the west has the cave, ridge and cairn fields.
