"""Crownwater's material recipes and architectural kit.

WHY THIS IS NOT IN `_toolkit/`
------------------------------
The production guide says a region needing new material recipes and kit pieces
should add them to the shared toolkit rather than fork it. It is right, and this
module is written so that promoting it is a move, not a rewrite: the recipes are
plain `TextureSet` factories with the same signature as everything in
`textures.py`, and the specs are plain `MaterialSpec` tuples.

It lives here for now for one reason: at the time of writing, three other
sessions are producing regions against the same `_toolkit/`, and one of them has
an uncommitted block appending nine `MaterialSpec`s and four terrain classes to
`materials.py`. Three independent appends to one `SPECS` tuple is precisely the
silent-corruption case that file's own comment warns about. So Crownwater adds
its materials by *extending the table at build time* instead of editing it:
`register()` appends to `materials.SPECS` in memory, before either registrar
reads it. Nothing in `_toolkit/` is modified, so there is no merge conflict to
resolve, and the promotion later is a copy-paste of `SPECS_EXTRA` into
`materials.SPECS` plus the four factories into `textures.py`.

Every name here is `crownwater_`-prefixed, so it cannot collide with any other
region's additions even after promotion.

WHAT THE CONCEPT NEEDS THAT AMBERWOOD HAS NOT GOT
-------------------------------------------------
Amberwood is a forest region: bark, foliage, timber, thatch, amber. Crownwater
is a masonry city on water. The four recipes below are the ones without which
the painting cannot be reproduced at all - verdigris copper and gold leaf are
the entire colour signature of the concept's skyline, and neither has any
stand-in in the existing thirty-seven materials.
