"""The authored Crownwater region plan.

Coordinates are Godot metres, Y up, north toward -Z. The playable footprint is
the server's 576-cell grid at one metre per tile with the arrival datum at
server (174, 174), which lands on the Godot origin:

    godot_x = server_x - 174        godot_z = 174 - server_y

so the reachable area is x in [-174, 401] and z in [-401, 174]. The terrain is
cut larger than that on every side, and the surplus is drowned or walled so a
player can never walk off the authored world.

Composition follows the aerial concept, which is not a landscape with a lake in
it but a *lagoon with a city in it*: a broad shallow turquoise basin, a single
large crowned island at its centre carrying the domed cathedral complex, a ring
of eight smaller pavilion islets around it, a wider scatter of outer islets, and
stone causeways stitching the whole thing together over open water.

The one structural decision that follows from that reading: **the lagoon floor
is terrain, not a hole.** The client grounds actors by casting a ray down at
every server tile, not only walkable ones, so a region whose middle is water
still needs a continuous surface underneath it. Crownwater's heightfield covers
the entire footprint and simply sits below sea level across most of it. That is
what makes zero grounding misses achievable on a map that is mostly sea.
