"""Crownwater's camera set and detail-board panel mapping.

Per-region data used by the shared toolkit's `capture_views.py` and
`make_comparison.py`, and - via `camera-views.json`, which the build emits from
this same table - by the in-client capture harness
`godot-client/tests/integration/rendered_crownwater.gd`.

One table, two consumers, so an offline preview and a real client frame are
always the same framing and can be compared honestly.

Coordinates are design-space (x, z) pairs, the same 192 m space `region.py` is
written in, so they scale with the region. Heights are metres **above the local
ground**, not absolute Y - a camera given an absolute height ends up underground
the moment the terrain changes.
