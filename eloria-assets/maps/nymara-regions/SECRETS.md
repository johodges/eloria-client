# The secrets

Every exterior map has a `<region>_secrets` map: its hidden rooms, entered by
*using* a feature of the ground above (a loose stone, a hollow tree, a crack in
the ice), some only with an item in the pack. Inside a secret the client draws
only that secret; the rest of the map, the minimap and the full map stay black.
The rooms come from `_toolkit/secretrooms.py`, the maps from
`_toolkit/secrets_build.py`, the entrances from `_toolkit/secretdoors.py` (or
Sunmane's own kit, or the hand-declared list for Four Gates), and the server's
portals, interactives, spawns, nodes and areas from
`eloria-assets/tools/secret_doors.py` through the continent portal tool and the
content tool's `secrets` stage. `design` tables live in each region's
`source/secrets_design.py`.
