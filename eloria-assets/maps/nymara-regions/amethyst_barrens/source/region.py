"""The authored Amethyst Barrens region plan.

Coordinates are Godot metres, Y up, north toward -Z. The playable footprint is
the server's 576-cell grid at one metre per tile with the arrival datum at
server (174, 174), which lands on the Godot origin:

    godot_x = server_x - 174        godot_z = 174 - server_y

so the reachable area is x in [-174, 401] and z in [-401, 174]. The terrain is
cut larger than that on every side, and the surplus is raised or drowned so a
player can never walk off the authored world.

Composition follows the aerial concept (`references/01-concept-aerial-overview.png`):

  * the Glasswarden Observatory on its terrace in the north-west, the armillary
    sphere on its dome the tallest built thing in the region;
  * a great crystal massif erupting from the northern uplands, the pale violet
    shards that dominate the top of the painting;
  * grey mountains closing the north-west and north;
  * sea biting into the north-east and south-east corners, with a dry headland
    of upland rock between them on the east edge;
  * a broad ochre barrens basin filling the middle and south, storm-scoured,
    threaded with resonant roads and veined with amethyst;
  * one river running out of the northern mountains south-east to the sea.

The ten-panel detail board (`references/00-concept-detail-board.png`) is the
player-scale authority and is what the landmark kit is modelled from.
