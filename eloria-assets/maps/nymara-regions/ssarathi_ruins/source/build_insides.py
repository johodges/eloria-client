"""Build Ssarathi Ruins' four insides as ONE map with blackspace between them.

Eternal Lands puts a region's interiors on a single map, laid out as islands of
floor with unwalkable void between, rather than one map file per room.
`amethyst_barrens_insides` and `crownwater_insides` already do this in the
repository; this follows them. One package, one GLB, one collision grid, four
sections, one spawn and one exit portal per section.

WHY THE BLACKSPACE IS FREE
--------------------------
Nothing has to draw the void. `build_collision` marks a cell walkable only where
a `Walk_` surface actually covers it, so every cell between the sections is
already zero - which is exactly what "blocked" means in EWCG v1 and what the
server reads as blackspace. The gaps are wide enough that no section's geometry,
lamps or grounding ray can reach another's.

The Royal Archive is 68 x 135 m on its own and sets the map size; the other
three fit around it. Closest approach between any two sections is 60 m.
