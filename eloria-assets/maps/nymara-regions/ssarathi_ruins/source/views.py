"""Ssarathi Ruins' camera set and detail-board panel mapping.

Per-region data used by the shared toolkit's `capture_views.py` and
`make_comparison.py`, and - via `camera-views.json`, which the build emits from
this same table - by the in-client Godot capture harness. One table, two
consumers, so an offline preview and a real client frame are always the same
framing and can be compared honestly.

Coordinates are design-space (x, z) pairs, the same 192 m space `region.py` is
written in, so they scale with the region. Heights are metres **above the local
ground**, not absolute Y - a camera given an absolute height ends up underground
the moment the terrain changes, which is the trap the production guide names.

Two things specific to a flooded region:

* An eye height measured over water is measured from the *basin floor*, which
  is 1.5 to 4.6 m below the surface. A "1.7 m" camera standing on a causeway
  and a "1.7 m" camera out over the channel are three metres apart in world Y.
  Every over-water framing here therefore has its height set from the floor it
  actually stands on, not copied from a land framing.
* The great axis runs north at design x = 20, so a panel-1 framing is a low
  camera *on* the causeway looking up it - not across it.
