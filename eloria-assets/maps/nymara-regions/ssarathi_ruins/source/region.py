"""The authored Ssarathi Ruins region plan.

Coordinates are Godot metres, Y up, north toward -Z. The playable footprint is
the server's 576-cell grid at one metre per tile with the arrival datum at
server (174, 174), which lands on the Godot origin:

    godot_x = server_x - 174        godot_z = 174 - server_y

so the reachable area is x in [-174, 401] and z in [-401, 174]. The terrain is
cut larger than that on every side and the surplus is raised into jungle-clad
valley walls, so a player can never walk off the authored world.

WHAT THE PAINTING ACTUALLY SHOWS
--------------------------------
Not a grey ruin field. The aerial is a *drowned serpent city in a flooded
jungle basin*: shallow turquoise water covering almost the whole floor, lily
pads across it, and a grid of raised stone causeways and platforms standing a
metre or two out of it, all in verdigris jade and gilt under heavy vine and
root overgrowth. A stepped ziggurat temple dominates the north-centre with
waterfalls coming off the cliffs behind it, and a single broad causeway runs
dead north up the middle to its foot. Round colonnaded pool-courts sit either
side of that axis. Timber docks and a small canvas market fringe the east and
south. Jungle closes every horizon.

THE ONE STRUCTURAL DECISION EVERYTHING ELSE FOLLOWS FROM
---------------------------------------------------------
The client grounds actors by casting a ray straight down at every server tile,
not only the walkable ones, so a region whose middle is water still needs
continuous ground under it. Ssarathi's heightfield therefore covers the entire
footprint and simply sits below the waterline across most of it - the basin
floor is *terrain*, not a hole.

The second half of that decision is what the causeways are made of. Crownwater
spans its open water with built bridge decks, because its islands stand in deep
lagoon. Ssarathi's water is ankle-to-knee deep almost everywhere, and the
concept's causeways are plainly solid stone embankments retained by walls at
the waterline - masonry fill, not viaduct. So they are built as *terrain
plateaus* carrying a paved surface class, not as `Walk_` decks over a void.

That is the safe choice for grounding as well as the accurate one: the walkable
city is terrain, which the ray cannot miss, and only the handful of genuine
spans over carved channels - panel 4's arch bridge and its siblings - are
authored decks that own their server cells.
