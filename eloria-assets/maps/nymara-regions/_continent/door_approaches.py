"""Authored road ends for doors that a retained structure encloses.

Door roads are routed from each territory's hub straight to the doorway. That
is right for a door in a wall that faces open ground, and wrong for the Shrine
of the Nine Lost in Verdant Stair: its door stands on the terrace of the South
Quay pavilion, whose west side is the pavilion's jade wall and whose only open
side is the north. The routed road arrived from the west, its last two
stations wet under the quay, so the bridge builder raised a nine-metre deck
that ends against the wall, while the served door tile (the terrace's north
edge) is reached from the north across plain ground.

A pin here ends the door road on the open side of such a pavilion; the retained
walking floor carries the last metres to the door and no deck is built. The
pinned end must be dry ground inside the door's own territory.

The module also holds the authored waypoints a road passes on its way: a door
road's (hub -> waypoint -> ... -> door end) and a seam road's (hub -> waypoint
-> ... -> crossing terminal). Both are routed in legs by ``route_in_legs``, so
a mountain pass climbs the switchback its valley suggests instead of taking the
router's shortest line. Waypoints obey the same rules as a pinned end: dry
ground, out of the water, inside the territory whose hub the road leaves.
