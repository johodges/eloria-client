"""River crossing sites: the only places a road may cross a plan river, and the water and bank it may not travel.

The owner's rules (2026-09-16): a road crosses a river only on a bridge, at the locally shortest crossing, square to
the flow and at a narrow reach; several bridges on one river are allowed when they stand at least 100 m apart along
it; a road travelling in a river's direction runs parallel on the bank outside a setback, never along or over the
channel.

Cross sections. Every plan river is cut every ``sample_metres`` along its curved centreline (the curve
landscape.water_fields uses). A section's cost is its wet width square to the centreline plus an approach term: the
bank rise, between the deck (the water surface plus ``deck_clearance_metres``) and the ground ``landing_metres``
beyond each wet edge, that ``approach_grade`` cannot absorb over that landing. A section is excluded when its span or
its routed landings touch a lake or the sea, come within ``confluence_metres`` of another river's channel, cross the
rigid core of a settlement footing (``footing_weight``), cross a retained solid, come within ``seam_metres`` of a territory
seam, stand more than ``perpendicular_tolerance_degrees`` off square to the local flow, land on anything but dry
ground above the sea, or need a deck that would stand more than ``deck_lift_metres`` over its banks (deck_fit).

Candidates. A section is a candidate when its cost is within a quarter metre of the cheapest valid section within
``local_window_metres`` along its river; candidates closer than ``CANDIDATE_SPACING_METRES`` keep only the cheapest,
so a uniform reach still offers a crossing every twenty metres. A candidate whose approach term exceeds
``maximum_approach_metres`` is a last resort, offered only to a leg that finds no other way.

Authored crossings. The plan key ``authored_crossings`` names a river section (river id and metres along it) that
is a candidate although the model excludes it, when every reason is one landscape.AUTHORED_CROSSING_WAIVERS allows: a
deck that cannot sit at water level between high banks, or a retained solid beside a routed landing. It replaces the
candidates within CANDIDATE_SPACING_METRES of it and is never a last resort.

Sites are claimed by roads. The router (world_layout.World._route) treats river water and its setback as impassable
and joins the two routed landings of every available crossing with one bridge edge: each site already claimed in the
leg's territory, and each candidate there that stands ``minimum_spacing_metres`` along its river from every claimed
site. A new crossing costs ``bridge_cost_metres`` of alignment on top of its length; a site a public road (seam, ferry
or door road) already crosses costs ``shared_bridge_factor`` of that, so later roads share it. A routed road claims
the candidates it crosses; the claimed set is the continent's bridge sites, always at least the spacing apart.
