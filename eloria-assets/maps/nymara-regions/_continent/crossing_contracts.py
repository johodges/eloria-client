"""Declared bridge crossings, taken from the served collision fold.

A territory's ``navigation.crossings`` names two standing points on each
continental bridge floor. The server keeps the deck through its own fold and
walks every declared pair on the vendored grid, so a declaration is only true
when both points sit on tiles that the fold actually serves and that a walker
can reach from one another under the climb limit.

The geometry stage cannot know that: the fold blocks any metre tile whose four
authored half-cells are not all walkable, so a point one bridge-field cell
inside a narrow diagonal floor can land on a pinched tile. This module runs in
the contracts stage, after the fold, on exactly the grid the server will hold:
it rasterises each ``Walk_ContinentalBridgeUnion_*_<region>`` floor with the
collision exporter's own rasteriser, keeps the tiles the floor fully covers,
joins them through at most one plain walkable ground tile (a floor interrupted
by a metre of bank is still one crossing), takes the largest climb-connected
part and declares its two extreme tiles along the floor's long axis. Since the
roads pass (R1) every floor is one bridge site's deck (bridge_export names it
by the site: its number is the site's id plus one; decks over deep water away
from any site number from 500), so a declaration is a site's crossing and
names the site it serves. Floors
whose largest part holds fewer than three deck tiles, or no more than half of
the floor's deck tiles, are reported instead of declared: a structure standing on
the deck, or a pinch, is something to fix or to state, not to hide behind a
declaration the server would fail.
