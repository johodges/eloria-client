"""Trails from the road network to authored resource sites on steep ground and to posts out of reach.

The contract placer seats every harvest node and territory marker on a
hub-connected tile within its movement budget (35 m). A site in broadly
steep ground has such a tile only where a road corridor crosses the slope:
the Whitehorn peat nodes and the range's territory marker were reached
through the fourteenth publication because a public road happened to run past
them, and alignments that keep off steep traverses no longer do. After the
public, door and discovery roads exist, this module routes a narrow trail from
the nearest road station to every cluster of such sites, so the served fold
keeps a walkable corridor at each site whatever the public network does. A
site on a locally steep spot with gentler ground inside its budget, or with a
road inside its budget, needs none: the placer moves it there. A road station
counts as within reach only when the ground between can be walked: one 25 m
away and 24 m higher serves nothing. An NPC post (npcs.txt, budget 12 m) with
a station within 30 m is served by one inside its budget or within walkable
reach, and gets a trail otherwise, whatever its ground: the Motherroot Voice
stands on the Great Tree's root plateau, a rigid footing nine metres above
the village floor whose flanks no corridor can grade, and the fourteenth and
the fifteenth's first chains reached her only where a discovery branch
happened to pass. A post with no station within 30 m follows the site rule:
level quay and moor posts far from any road stand on ground the placer
serves, and only steep ground earns a trail. The post rule is built and
tested but the vendored posts are not read yet (POST_RULES stands apart from
RULES): the fifteenth's chains showed that the reach test cannot see an
island (a station within reach on the far side of an ungradable flank still
counted as service for the Motherroot Voice) and that the trail built for
another Amberwood post cut the Amberwood-Whitehorn crossing off from the hub.

The authored records are read from the vendored server profile with the same
columns the publisher rewrites (``publish_continent_geography.RULES``):
harvesting.txt node rows carry their map in column 1 and tile in columns 3-4;
territories.txt rows carry their map in column 2 and three tiles in columns
4-5, 6-7 and 8-9.
